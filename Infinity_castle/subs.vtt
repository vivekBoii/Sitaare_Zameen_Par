00:18.120 --> 00:21.980
In the next five days Muzan will come...

00:28.610 --> 00:34.260
Use me as bait and cut off Muzan's head...

00:38.600 --> 00:42.060
What makes you think that?

00:45.510 --> 00:47.700
Just my intuition. That's all.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.330
No other reason.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.620
The other children won't agree...

00:54.980 --> 01:01.700
to use me as bait...

01:02.660 --> 01:06.530
You're the only one that I can ask, Gyomei.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.070
That man may not die if you cut off his neck.

01:14.690 --> 01:21.090
Most likely, the only thing that
 can destroy Muzan is sunlight.

01:22.880 --> 01:27.240
Meaning if he doesn't die even after
 you've destroyed his head...

01:28.520 --> 01:31.720
You'll be in for a drawn-out battle until the sun rises.

01:33.630 --> 01:34.760
Understood.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.500
If that is your wish, Master.

01:42.600 --> 01:43.620
Thank you.

01:50.020 --> 01:50.530
Please...

01:51.810 --> 01:59.750
Don't let any more of
my precious children die.

02:18.590 --> 02:22.000
So, you think you've
driven me into a corner?

02:23.810 --> 02:27.290
You're all about to go straight to Hell!

02:27.300 --> 02:29.900
You eyesore Demon Slayers!

02:29.900 --> 02:32.930
Tonight, I'm going to massacre
every one of you!

02:37.800 --> 02:40.430
You're the one who's going to Hell, Muzan!

02:40.430 --> 02:42.190
You're not getting away!

02:43.010 --> 02:45.000
Do it, then!

02:45.000 --> 02:49.560
Let's see you try, Kamado Tanjiro!

02:52.800 --> 02:58.300
I'll absolutely defeat you, Kibutsuji Muzan!

03:34.210 --> 03:35.850
Calm down, Kanroji!

03:37.030 --> 03:37.960
Okay.

03:38.410 --> 03:39.410
Stay close.

Tada, tada mae wo muite tobe

04:38.780 --> 04:40.250
I have to hurry!

04:48.570 --> 04:49.470
Right there!

04:50.200 --> 04:51.880
If I crash into the ground, I'll die!

04:52.230 --> 04:56.650
I need to use a technique
to change my trajectory!

05:00.020 --> 05:04.070
My positioning is too off!

06:53.850 --> 06:56.710
<i>He was able to tell what
technique I was gonna use.</i>

06:57.220 --> 07:00.800
<i>Then he made sure to use an
attack that wouldn't interfere with mine.</i>

07:01.570 --> 07:03.110
<i>It's freaky!</i>

07:04.200 --> 07:05.920
<i>What's up with his face?</i>

07:09.250 --> 07:14.720
This is probably the demon hideout
that Shinazugawa and Iguro mentioned.

07:18.180 --> 07:25.150
So why do you think that Kibutsuji brought
all of the Hashira and the other slayers here?

07:26.930 --> 07:30.980
From now on, we'll have
to constantly stay on guard.

07:31.720 --> 07:32.300
Right.

07:34.630 --> 07:35.440
Let's go.

07:35.470 --> 07:36.020
Right.

07:58.950 --> 08:01.600
<i>Serpent Breathing, Fifth Form:</i>

<i>Iguro-san's so cool!</i>

08:22.480 --> 08:23.470
Are you hurt?

08:23.490 --> 08:24.420
Nope!

08:24.650 --> 08:25.270
Let's go.

08:25.290 --> 08:26.300
Okay!

08:47.140 --> 08:48.220
Tokito!

08:55.170 --> 08:57.450
There's a lot of demons here, huh?

08:57.720 --> 09:04.190
They must all be here
to try to wear us down.

09:10.330 --> 09:11.650
What happened to the Master?

09:12.640 --> 09:14.640
He's awaiting us in the afterlife.

09:16.090 --> 09:17.950
It was a magnificent end.

09:19.700 --> 09:24.750
I can't imagine him making the
mistake of letting a demon find him.

09:25.490 --> 09:26.720
Was it bait?

09:28.370 --> 09:29.220
That's right.

09:29.940 --> 09:32.170
He knew his days were already numbered.

09:39.330 --> 09:40.700
<i>Master...</i>

09:47.680 --> 09:54.350
The first time I encountered a demon,
I was left on the verge of death.

09:54.830 --> 09:56.930
He never left my side.

09:59.280 --> 10:03.970
He's done the same for countless others, too.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.550
Like a father...

10:09.920 --> 10:11.840
Yeah, he did.

10:12.850 --> 10:17.390
Muzan's taken not only my brother,
but also my second father.

10:18.770 --> 10:20.030
Damn you!

10:20.050 --> 10:25.880
Muzan, I'll make you suffer
before I send you to Hell!

10:27.220 --> 10:28.530
Don't worry.

10:33.150 --> 10:36.300
We all feel the same way.

10:43.270 --> 10:49.410
Master, I've failed...

11:04.790 --> 11:07.850
Keep coming, one after the other...

11:11.020 --> 11:13.220
Bring it on.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.540
I'll slaughter every one of you!

11:24.990 --> 11:27.920
Comin' through!

11:30.890 --> 11:32.770
I dunno how I ended up here...

11:34.300 --> 11:38.000
But since demons keep on showin' up...

11:38.240 --> 11:44.620
It's the perfect time to
test out all that training!

11:54.970 --> 11:56.420
<i>What is this place?</i>

11:56.920 --> 11:58.090
<i>A demon fortress?</i>

11:58.110 --> 11:59.450
<i>Where are the others?</i>

12:00.190 --> 12:01.200
<i>Brother...</i>

12:02.590 --> 12:04.550
<i>Please be safe!</i>

12:09.590 --> 12:14.340
I hear something, that guy must be nearby.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.550
I can't believe it.

12:23.240 --> 12:26.800
I'll never forgive you for what you did!

12:51.270 --> 12:52.700
<i>I smell blood.</i>

13:02.020 --> 13:03.100
Where am I?

13:22.540 --> 13:25.070
Someone's arrived.

13:25.740 --> 13:28.330
Whoa! It's a girl, too!

13:28.940 --> 13:31.870
You look beautiful and delicious!

13:33.170 --> 13:36.850
I'll have to thank Nakime-chan later.

13:52.170 --> 13:53.590
Shinobu

13:54.970 --> 13:57.140
Please leave the Demon Slayer Corps.

13:58.850 --> 14:04.500
You're always pushing yourself
so hard, you're really trying.

14:06.020 --> 14:08.180
But, Shinobu...

14:13.980 --> 14:17.790
I just want you to live a happy life.

14:18.670 --> 14:21.600
I want you to live to be an old woman.

14:25.220 --> 14:26.570
For me, that's enough...

14:26.590 --> 14:27.280
No!

14:27.900 --> 14:31.670
I'd never just give up! I'll avenge you!

14:32.320 --> 14:36.370
Tell me, what did the
demon that did this look like?

14:37.440 --> 14:40.600
Tell me sis, please!

14:41.600 --> 14:47.170
How could I ever live a happy
life after someone did this to you?

14:52.080 --> 14:56.420
It was a demon who looked like
blood was spilled on his head.

14:58.270 --> 15:01.350
Hey there, it's very nice to meet you!

15:01.720 --> 15:03.940
My name is Doma.

15:04.510 --> 15:07.340
It's a nice night, isn't it?

15:09.290 --> 15:15.990
He spoke calmly and wouldn't stop grinning.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.400
H-H-Help...

15:20.990 --> 15:22.330
Help me!

15:22.350 --> 15:23.990
Shhh!

15:24.010 --> 15:26.200
I'm talking right now.

15:31.270 --> 15:32.470
Are you okay?

15:33.320 --> 15:35.800
Whoa! You're fast!

15:35.830 --> 15:37.340
Are you a Hashira?

15:46.820 --> 15:49.760
It's fine, just leave her there!

15:50.200 --> 15:52.230
I'll make sure she doesn't go to waste!

15:55.800 --> 16:02.400
The weapon that demon
used were a pair of sharp fans.

16:05.330 --> 16:09.150
I'm the founder of
the Eternal Paradise Faith.

16:09.570 --> 16:13.020
It's my duty to ensure
my disciples are happy.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.990
So I'll devour her, leaving nothing behind.

16:17.800 --> 16:21.770
This is the demon who killed my sister.

16:23.490 --> 16:25.220
Make sure they're happy?

16:25.540 --> 16:27.000
Don't make me laugh.

16:27.670 --> 16:30.520
This girl was just screaming for help.

16:31.070 --> 16:32.920
And I helped her, didn't I?

16:33.730 --> 16:36.600
She's no longer feeling any pain.

16:36.800 --> 16:40.050
Nor is she suffering nor afraid.

16:40.720 --> 16:43.370
Everyone is afraid of death.

16:43.710 --> 16:46.120
That's why I eat them all.

16:46.510 --> 16:50.940
That way they get to live
on forever inside of me.

16:51.820 --> 16:56.220
I take in all of my disciples'
feelings, blood, and flesh.

16:56.240 --> 17:01.190
All so they can be rescued
and guided to paradise.

17:02.170 --> 17:04.390
You're insane.

17:05.140 --> 17:07.040
Are you okay in the head?

17:07.600 --> 17:09.390
You really make me sick.

17:12.040 --> 17:15.790
We've only just met,
why are you being so harsh?

17:15.820 --> 17:17.600
Oh, I know!

17:17.890 --> 17:19.300
How sad...

17:19.720 --> 17:22.070
Something must really be bothering you.

17:22.630 --> 17:25.370
I'm here to listen, feel free to tell me!

17:27.020 --> 17:29.690
Something must be bothering me?

17:30.140 --> 17:33.390
You killed my sister!

17:33.420 --> 17:36.100
Don't you recognize this haori?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.970
You mean that Flower Breathing swordswoman?

17:54.470 --> 17:57.040
She was such a kind girl.

17:57.640 --> 18:01.440
I remember not getting to finish
eating her because the sun was rising.

18:02.100 --> 18:04.220
But wanted to gobble her...

18:06.590 --> 18:09.300
<i>Insect Breathing, Dance of the Bumblebee:</i>

18:09.850 --> 18:10.870
<i>Sting!</i>

18:12.090 --> 18:13.690
What an incredible thrust!

18:13.710 --> 18:15.610
I couldn't stop it in time!

18:17.740 --> 18:18.670
<i>Blood Demon Art:</i>

18:20.790 --> 18:22.370
<i>Frozen Lotus!</i>

18:23.740 --> 18:24.630
<i>So cold!</i>

18:24.660 --> 18:27.020
<i>It feels like my lungs might freeze!</i>

18:29.740 --> 18:31.800
You really are fast!

18:32.220 --> 18:34.700
But it's no use.

18:34.720 --> 18:37.550
You can't kill demons
by stabbing their eyes.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.440
The neck...

18:42.940 --> 18:45.040
You need to sever the neck.

18:48.040 --> 18:52.050
Stabbing might not kill you,
but what about poison?

18:56.770 --> 19:00.890
<i>I wonder if this poison is strong
enough to kill an Upper Rank.</i>

19:02.210 --> 19:03.350
<i>Sister...</i>

19:03.990 --> 19:06.540
<i>Please, sister...</i>

19:09.320 --> 19:16.120
This is a lot stronger than the poison
you used on Rui-kun's mountain...

19:17.370 --> 19:20.030
<i>So they do share information.</i>

19:20.640 --> 19:22.320
<i>Poison is a double-edged sword.</i>

19:22.670 --> 19:29.450
I was told to look out for a mixture
that could adapt to any demon.

19:36.990 --> 19:43.290
Seems like I was able
to break down your poison.

19:43.310 --> 19:47.300
I'm sorry!
You probably worked very hard on it.

19:49.210 --> 19:54.090
That sword makes a very
unique sound when you sheathe it.

19:54.870 --> 19:58.020
Is that when you change the compound?

19:58.340 --> 20:01.300
Whoa! This is fun!

20:01.820 --> 20:04.870
I kinda like being poisoned!

20:04.890 --> 20:09.320
Hey, do you think the next one will work?

20:09.340 --> 20:11.250
Let's try it!

20:17.690 --> 20:19.270
Is that so?

20:19.970 --> 20:21.080
Fine with me.

20:21.690 --> 20:22.610
After all...

20:26.160 --> 20:28.840
I've anticipated everything so far!

20:30.960 --> 20:32.740
Is the mixture ready?

20:33.070 --> 20:35.020
It's okay to come at me anytime.

20:39.310 --> 20:42.140
I said let's try it...

20:43.690 --> 20:46.610
But it's boring if you
just use the same technique.

21:01.770 --> 21:05.220
That's slower than before.

21:07.390 --> 21:10.040
<i>Insect Breathing, Dance of the Bumblebee:</i>

21:10.450 --> 21:11.690
<i>Complete Flutter!</i>

21:20.140 --> 21:23.040
What's this?
I've already built a resistance.

21:23.300 --> 21:25.800
That way you parried my attack...

21:25.830 --> 21:31.970
It was amazing, it was like the
collected output of all your effort!

21:32.230 --> 21:38.370
Keep 'em coming, you don't have to
wait for me to decompose the poison!

21:38.630 --> 21:42.740
I love supporting people
who are trying their best!

21:49.230 --> 21:51.690
Yes! Just like that!

21:54.500 --> 21:58.390
I've been kind and clever
ever since I was a kid.

21:59.620 --> 22:04.770
I've always tried my best to help
people in need and make them happy.

22:05.230 --> 22:07.120
Because that's my duty.

22:08.730 --> 22:11.600
This child's eyes have rainbows.

22:12.470 --> 22:15.850
Pale hair is a sign of innocence.

22:16.730 --> 22:18.700
This child is special.

22:19.220 --> 22:21.750
I'm sure he can hear the voice of God.

22:23.880 --> 22:27.380
<i>My parents were unbelievably stupid.</i>

22:28.290 --> 22:33.160
<i>They even went out of their way
to create the Eternal Paradise Faith.</i>

22:34.390 --> 22:36.240
<i>I felt so sorry for them.</i>

22:36.710 --> 22:39.320
<i>That's the only reason I played along.</i>

22:40.840 --> 22:43.320
<i>Not once did I ever hear the voice of God.</i>

22:44.720 --> 22:50.540
<i>At first, I found it awkward
to have people pray to me.</i>

22:51.840 --> 22:58.150
<i>These adults were crying to a child
about their miseries, begging for advice.</i>

22:58.370 --> 23:01.150
<i>I began to wonder if
they were all just crazy.</i>

23:02.570 --> 23:05.500
<i>After I yawned through
their boring life stories...</i>

23:06.340 --> 23:09.920
<i>They'd bow their heads and
beg me to lead them to paradise.</i>

23:11.270 --> 23:12.540
<i>It made me cry.</i>

23:13.800 --> 23:14.990
<i>How sad...</i>

23:15.910 --> 23:18.300
<i>This "paradise" doesn't exist.</i>

23:19.240 --> 23:23.200
<i>It's just a made up delusion
born from human imagination.</i>

23:24.360 --> 23:26.550
<i>Gods do not exist.</i>

23:27.520 --> 23:32.470
<i>It's so simple, yet these people
who've lived for decades have no idea.</i>

23:33.750 --> 23:35.750
<i>Once you die, there's nothing.</i>

23:36.390 --> 23:38.280
<i>You just stop feeling.</i>

23:39.780 --> 23:41.250
<i>Your heart stops...</i>

23:41.720 --> 23:42.930
<i>Your brain stops...</i>

23:43.300 --> 23:45.090
<i>And your body rots.</i>

23:46.120 --> 23:48.820
<i>It's unavoidable for all living creatures.</i>

23:51.750 --> 23:54.360
<i>They simply could not accept that reality.</i>

23:55.330 --> 23:57.180
<i>It must be hard being so stupid.</i>

23:58.460 --> 24:03.560
<i>I wanted to help these pitiful
people find their happiness.</i>

24:04.800 --> 24:08.850
<i>That must be the reason why I was born.</i>

24:16.840 --> 24:20.890
Seems like number five didn't work either.

24:21.700 --> 24:24.000
They're getting less and less effective.

24:24.520 --> 24:27.560
How many more do you think you can make?

24:28.100 --> 24:30.150
Oh, you're losing your breath!

24:30.920 --> 24:32.380
Your sweating an awful lot.

24:32.710 --> 24:33.480
Are you okay?

24:34.530 --> 24:37.660
<i>This is the strength of an Upper Rank.</i>

24:38.210 --> 24:40.280
<i>My poison isn't working at all.</i>

24:41.230 --> 24:43.980
<i>It's stupid how quickly
he builds a resistance.</i>

24:46.520 --> 24:49.290
Your lungs are giving out, right?

24:50.850 --> 24:55.790
After all, you did breathe in
my Blood Demon Art.

24:58.050 --> 25:02.420
<i>He turned his blood into frozen
mist and scattered it with those fans.</i>

25:03.430 --> 25:06.740
<i>It's too dangerous to even breathe.</i>

25:14.520 --> 25:18.050
<i>I'll hit him with
multiple doses all at once!</i>

25:19.500 --> 25:22.170
<i>Insect Breathing, Dance of the Dragonfly:</i>

25:29.170 --> 25:31.150
Compound Eye Hexagon!

25:33.890 --> 25:36.960
No, you actually are fast!

25:37.480 --> 25:41.070
Maybe the fastest Hashira I've ever met.

25:45.070 --> 25:47.440
Why won't...

25:49.460 --> 25:53.170
You should've at least
tried cutting my neck.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.810
With that speed,
you probably could've done it.

25:57.960 --> 26:01.640
Maybe not, you're really tiny after all.

26:04.970 --> 26:08.460
<i>Why are my hands so tiny?</i>

26:10.090 --> 26:13.010
<i>Why did I never grow any taller?</i>

26:15.040 --> 26:18.210
<i>If my body was just a bit bigger...</i>

26:18.820 --> 26:21.320
<i>I might've been able to defeat this demon.</i>

26:22.720 --> 26:28.290
<i>The bigger your arms and legs are,
the more muscles they can hold...</i>

26:28.570 --> 26:29.750
<i>It's a huge advantage...</i>

26:32.770 --> 26:37.590
<i>Despite being taller than me,
my sister was just as delicate.</i>

26:39.750 --> 26:41.970
<i>I envy Himejima-san.</i>

26:42.950 --> 26:47.000
<i>Once he shows up,
everyone knows they can take it easy.</i>

26:51.200 --> 26:56.600
<i>I know what my sister was trying to say...</i>

27:00.350 --> 27:03.870
Are you done already?

27:04.520 --> 27:05.690
It can't be helped...

27:09.380 --> 27:12.330
<i>"You'll probably just end up dying too."</i>

27:13.480 --> 27:17.100
<i>She started to say it, but stopped...</i>

27:18.250 --> 27:19.550
Pull yourself together.

27:25.900 --> 27:27.500
Don't cry over this.

27:29.300 --> 27:30.300
<i>Sister...</i>

27:31.060 --> 27:32.010
Stand up.

27:32.800 --> 27:33.910
<i>I can't!</i>

27:34.200 --> 27:39.310
<i>I've lost so much blood
and my lungs are ripped to shreds.</i>

27:40.230 --> 27:41.500
That doesn't matter.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.850
Stand up, Insect Hashira, Kocho Shinobu.

27:48.490 --> 27:50.740
When you decide to defeat
a demon, you defeat it.

27:51.190 --> 27:53.300
When you decide to win, you win.

27:54.690 --> 27:56.740
No matter the cost.

27:57.600 --> 28:01.150
Didn't you promise me and Kanao?

28:03.850 --> 28:05.070
<i>Kanao...</i>

28:08.310 --> 28:09.660
I'm sorry.

28:10.060 --> 28:12.130
You must be in a lot of pain.

28:17.380 --> 28:19.270
Shinobu, you can do this.

28:19.990 --> 28:20.810
Good luck.

28:28.260 --> 28:31.860
Can you actually still stand?

28:32.580 --> 28:35.810
Are you sure you're human?

28:36.350 --> 28:40.450
Your collarbone, lungs,
and ribs must all be smashed.

28:41.350 --> 28:47.830
For your size, I'm surprised you're
not already dead from the blood loss.

28:49.050 --> 28:50.500
Ew, see!

28:50.520 --> 28:56.050
The blood building up in your lungs
is making that awful gurgling sound!

28:56.720 --> 29:00.650
I'll kill you now so that you
don't have to suffer anymore.

29:01.600 --> 29:04.870
You're beyond saving, just give up!

29:05.240 --> 29:07.750
<i>If I'm gonna do this,
it has to be the neck.</i>

29:08.340 --> 29:11.240
<i>If I inject enough poison
into his neck, I can win!</i>

29:12.450 --> 29:13.870
<i>Insect Breathing,</i>

29:14.170 --> 29:15.390
<i>Dance of the Centipede:</i>

29:17.500 --> 29:19.000
<i>Hundred-Legged Zigzag!</i>

29:42.800 --> 29:45.370
<i>She's weaving around in every direction.</i>

29:46.190 --> 29:48.270
<i>And with so much force,
she broke the bridge.</i>

29:51.150 --> 29:54.100
<i>Too fast! I can't read her attack!</i>

30:00.140 --> 30:01.220
<i>Below!</i>

30:14.890 --> 30:22.670
<i>I once believed that the road of happiness
continued forever into the distance.</i>

30:23.140 --> 30:24.620
<i>But I realized...</i>

30:28.370 --> 30:30.270
<i>Once it was destroyed...</i>

30:31.200 --> 30:36.580
<i>That happiness rests
upon a thin layer of glass.</i>

30:39.850 --> 30:40.580
<i>And...</i>

30:41.600 --> 30:43.830
<i>Just as we were saved...</i>

30:45.190 --> 30:49.450
<i>There are others whose
happiness hasn't been destroyed yet.</i>

30:50.600 --> 30:54.330
<i>I wanted to get stronger, to protect them.</i>

30:56.140 --> 30:59.880
<i>That was our promise.</i>

31:02.340 --> 31:07.840
<i>"Let's defeat as many
demons as we can, both of us."</i>

31:10.950 --> 31:16.220
<i>"We can't let anyone else go
through what we just experienced."</i>

31:25.020 --> 31:26.720
<i>Even if I'm weak...</i>

31:30.670 --> 31:32.920
<i>Even if I can't cut a demon's neck...</i>

31:34.020 --> 31:37.250
<i>If I can defeat one demon,
I can save dozens of lives.</i>

31:37.870 --> 31:42.930
<i>If I can defeat an Upper Rank,
I can save hundreds.</i>

31:44.840 --> 31:50.770
<i>It's not about whether I can or can't,
there are some things that must be done.</i>

31:56.300 --> 31:57.640
Are you angry?

31:59.870 --> 32:04.700
<i>Yes, I am angry, Tanjiro-kun.</i>

32:05.400 --> 32:11.200
<i>For a very long time now, I've been angry.</i>

32:14.180 --> 32:15.650
<i>My parents were killed.</i>

32:17.550 --> 32:18.950
<i>My sister was killed.</i>

32:20.930 --> 32:23.620
<i>Other than Kanao,
all of my Tsuguko were killed.</i>

32:25.400 --> 32:26.560
<i>And those girls...</i>

32:27.970 --> 32:36.130
<i>If demons hadn't killed their families,
they'd be living happily with them right now.</i>

32:39.420 --> 32:42.030
<i>It drives me crazy!</i>

32:42.700 --> 32:44.830
<i>Oh come the hell on!</i>

32:46.000 --> 32:49.170
<i>Why won't my poison work on this guy?</i>

32:50.230 --> 32:51.730
<i>It's so stupid!</i>

33:03.360 --> 33:05.880
That was great! You tried so hard!

33:06.440 --> 33:11.680
I'm so moved!
I never expected you to be so impressive!

33:12.680 --> 33:17.060
You didn't have your sister's strength,
but you tried your best anyway!

33:17.990 --> 33:20.540
It's honestly a miracle you
were able to do this much!

33:23.310 --> 33:27.110
Despite knowing it was useless,
you still tried to take me down!

33:27.810 --> 33:31.990
This foolishness is what makes
humans so weak, yet so beautiful!

33:33.280 --> 33:35.840
You are certainly worthy
of being eaten by me.

33:36.860 --> 33:38.950
Let's live together for eternity!

33:42.710 --> 33:46.580
If you have any last words,
I'll pass them on for you.

33:51.440 --> 33:53.760
Go to Hell!

33:59.390 --> 34:00.290
Master!

34:31.960 --> 34:36.360
<i>I'm sure that guy is around here somewhere.</i>

34:37.300 --> 34:39.300
<i>He's probably looking for me, too.</i>

34:46.530 --> 34:54.300
<i>Everyone assumes the people
they care about will be around forever.</i>

34:55.160 --> 34:58.910
<i>But that's nothing
more than a flimsy desire.</i>

34:59.360 --> 35:00.630
<i>Flower Breathing,</i>

35:01.600 --> 35:05.290
<i>Nobody promised that it's an absolute certainty.</i>

35:05.310 --> 35:06.360
<i>Fourth Form:</i>

35:08.080 --> 35:09.730
<i>Crimson Hanagoromo!</i>

35:16.450 --> 35:18.870
That was close.

35:22.890 --> 35:25.000
<i>But for some reason...</i>

35:26.830 --> 35:31.850
<i>People still believe it to be true.</i>

35:35.320 --> 35:40.270
Please don't try to slash me
while I'm absorbing someone.

35:49.370 --> 35:50.310
Oh?

35:51.240 --> 35:53.270
You're not falling for my taunts?

35:54.520 --> 35:58.570
Did she signal something
to you with her fingers?

35:59.120 --> 36:01.650
Did she tell you about my powers?

36:02.680 --> 36:05.440
She only had a brief moment,
that's impressive.

36:06.020 --> 36:09.950
She never gave up, despite the futility.

36:13.000 --> 36:19.500
Anyway, tonight is my lucky night.

36:21.250 --> 36:25.830
Gorgeous feasts are showing up
one after the other.

36:27.200 --> 36:32.420
It really is a nice night.

36:46.900 --> 36:47.940
I know you're there.

36:48.670 --> 36:49.540
Come out, already.

36:50.850 --> 36:52.570
Stop wasting my time.

36:55.880 --> 37:00.700
That's no way to speak to your superior.

37:01.680 --> 37:05.100
You might've gotten a bit stronger
since the last time I saw you...

37:05.580 --> 37:09.670
But you're still as shabby as ever.

37:13.280 --> 37:20.560
UPPER SIX

37:14.750 --> 37:18.630
Long time no see, Zenitsu.

37:21.520 --> 37:22.700
Kaigaku...

37:23.370 --> 37:29.130
Now that you've become a demon,
I no longer acknowledge you as my senior.

37:42.780 --> 37:45.430
<i>Water Breathing, Ninth Form:</i>

37:47.020 --> 37:49.050
<i>Splashing Water Flow, Turbulent!</i>

37:51.940 --> 37:52.820
Stay sharp!

37:53.020 --> 37:53.600
Right!

37:55.370 --> 38:01.300
<i>This world is dangerous,
it moves as if its alive.</i>

38:02.150 --> 38:04.970
<i>It keeps trying to separate me from Giyu-san.</i>

38:06.050 --> 38:11.030
<i>We have to join up with
the others and find Muzan.</i>

38:19.100 --> 38:22.770
Deceased! Kocho Shinobu has died!

38:23.410 --> 38:27.520
She died fighting against Upper Two!

39:08.680 --> 39:12.550
<i>What is that crow wearing around its neck?</i>

39:13.150 --> 39:14.730
<i>That message came unusually fast.</i>

39:19.620 --> 39:21.020
Shinobu is dead.

39:21.870 --> 39:23.200
Don't stop your hands.

39:23.830 --> 39:26.070
We need as much information as possible.

39:26.870 --> 39:27.620
Okay.

39:30.370 --> 39:33.580
Are the other Hashira still alive?
What's the situation with the rest of my Demon Slayers?

39:35.550 --> 39:39.110
Four platforms away, twelve vertically.

39:41.180 --> 39:43.450
There's a battle on the center platform.

39:43.480 --> 39:45.680
Over 10 demons currently.

39:52.700 --> 39:56.610
And there are over 30 more approaching.

40:03.270 --> 40:07.480
<i>Yushiro-san's "eyes" can
perceive Blood Demon Art.</i>

40:08.120 --> 40:11.220
<i>He can see techniques
invisible to the human eye.</i>

40:12.320 --> 40:17.430
<i>Each light resembles an instance
of a demon's Blood Demon Art.</i>

40:18.770 --> 40:24.670
<i>The pulsing ones are the
techniques themselves.</i>

40:25.350 --> 40:27.720
<i>This place stretches forever.</i>

40:30.820 --> 40:32.520
<i>What kind of power...</i>

40:33.930 --> 40:37.980
<i>This is an infinite demon castle.</i>

40:41.670 --> 40:45.660
<i>And we were lured straight into it.</i>

40:50.100 --> 40:53.600
<i>But we weren't just lured in.</i>

40:54.310 --> 40:57.800
<i>My father made careful
preparations for a day like this.</i>

40:58.960 --> 41:04.260
<i>He planned for Gyomei to
regroup with the other Hashira.</i>

41:04.910 --> 41:11.300
<i>And gave assigned roles to the other
Demon Slayers prepare by Kasugai Crow.</i>

41:12.580 --> 41:15.800
<i>With the help of Tamayo-san, Yushiro-san...</i>

41:16.360 --> 41:25.710
<i>And the sacrifices of my sisters and parents.</i>

41:29.400 --> 41:32.780
We won't lose this battle.

41:39.270 --> 41:46.600
<i>Five massive powers radiate through
this area as if asserting their dominance.</i>

41:47.120 --> 41:49.080
<i>No doubt these are the Upper Ranks.</i>

41:50.180 --> 41:53.820
<i>One of them marks the place Shinobu died.</i>

41:54.670 --> 41:58.800
Upper Rank! Upper Six and Agatsuma
have just encountered each other!

41:59.070 --> 42:01.620
Another Upper Rank? What's the situation?

42:01.830 --> 42:04.350
Not good, Agatsuma is completely alone.

42:04.600 --> 42:07.320
Send as many people as you
can to that Upper Rank's location.

42:07.340 --> 42:08.480
Quickly!

42:15.450 --> 42:17.150
You haven't changed a bit.

42:17.670 --> 42:19.600
Still just a shabby little runt.

42:19.620 --> 42:21.760
Aren't you?

42:22.940 --> 42:24.730
Have you become a Hashira?

42:25.600 --> 42:27.910
Come on, Zenitsu.

42:29.190 --> 42:32.800
Have you learned anything
besides the first form?

42:34.050 --> 42:39.920
You're awfully cocky, seeing as
you're the lowest of the Upper Ranks.

42:44.030 --> 42:46.820
I see you've learned
to talk back, at least.

42:47.770 --> 42:50.020
Why did you become a demon?

42:51.600 --> 42:52.700
You have no—

42:52.730 --> 42:56.680
Why would a successor of
Thunder Breathing become a demon?

42:59.300 --> 43:01.320
If you hadn't become a demon...

43:01.700 --> 43:02.650
Gramps...

43:04.510 --> 43:06.180
Wouldn't have killed himself!

43:07.750 --> 43:08.700
Gramps...

43:09.720 --> 43:11.370
Slit his stomach open, alone!

43:12.960 --> 43:14.600
There was nobody to behead him!

43:16.030 --> 43:17.180
When you slit your stomach...

43:17.570 --> 43:19.520
If someone's not there
to cut your head off...

43:19.780 --> 43:22.220
You'll die a slow, agonizing death!

43:22.950 --> 43:23.970
Gramps...

43:24.630 --> 43:27.400
He could've slit his throat
or stabbed his heart instead!

43:28.000 --> 43:31.050
All because the line of
Thunder Breathing had produced a demon!

43:32.800 --> 43:34.680
That's not my problem.

43:35.280 --> 43:41.250
So, what? Are you saying I should repent?

43:41.980 --> 43:46.230
I have no respect for anyone
who doesn't value me properly.

43:46.980 --> 43:53.320
I will only ever work for
those who know my value!

43:55.620 --> 43:59.230
I'm relieved that old man
died a painful death.

43:59.920 --> 44:05.260
I worked so hard but he refused
to make me his sole successor.

44:05.280 --> 44:10.370
That old bastard told me to work alongside
dirt like you to share the successorship!

44:11.350 --> 44:16.850
He may have been a Hashira,
but he was senile in his later years for sure.

44:22.120 --> 44:24.620
Gramps wasn't senile.

44:25.320 --> 44:27.980
If I'm dirt, then you're trash.

44:28.700 --> 44:33.280
I might only be able to use
the first form, but you can't.

44:34.230 --> 44:38.480
Maybe Gramps died a miserable death
because he had such pathetic successors!

44:38.830 --> 44:42.450
Don't lump me in with you!

44:43.210 --> 44:45.650
<i>Thunder Breathing, Fourth Form:</i>

44:45.910 --> 44:46.950
<i>Distant Thunder!</i>

44:55.350 --> 44:57.360
Too slow, trash.

45:03.200 --> 45:04.380
<i>He cut me!</i>

45:04.780 --> 45:05.660
<i>He's fast!</i>

45:05.860 --> 45:07.390
<i>This guy...</i>

45:07.770 --> 45:10.930
<i>It's like he's a completely
different person.</i>

45:13.280 --> 45:15.220
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

45:26.000 --> 45:29.920
<i>There's no shame in kneeling
before absolute strength.</i>

45:31.320 --> 45:34.230
<i>As long as you live,
you can figure something out.</i>

45:36.720 --> 45:39.140
<i>Until you die, you haven't lost.</i>

45:40.350 --> 45:43.070
<i>You can bury your face in the dirt.</i>

45:43.630 --> 45:45.200
<i>You can lose your home.</i>

45:45.570 --> 45:47.480
<i>You can drink mud.</i>

45:48.100 --> 45:50.800
<i>You can get scolded for stealing.</i>

45:52.080 --> 45:54.960
<i>As long as you stay alive,
one day you'll win.</i>

45:55.520 --> 45:56.800
<i>I will win.</i>

45:57.290 --> 45:59.600
<i>That belief has carried me this far.</i>

46:01.900 --> 46:03.450
If you become a demon...

46:04.940 --> 46:07.300
You can access greater strength...

46:08.440 --> 46:11.500
If <i>he</i> recognizes you...

46:11.820 --> 46:14.550
Then you will become one of us.

46:18.850 --> 46:20.770
For a strong swordsman...

46:21.550 --> 46:24.270
It will take time to become a demon.

46:25.090 --> 46:27.870
It took me three days.

46:29.060 --> 46:32.640
For someone who uses
breathing techniques...

46:33.120 --> 46:37.770
It will require a great
amount of <i>his</i> blood.

46:39.200 --> 46:41.050
And in some cases...

46:41.450 --> 46:45.670
There are people whose bodies are
incompatible with the transformation.

46:47.050 --> 46:49.570
What about you?

46:53.820 --> 46:55.700
Be grateful for this opportunity.

46:56.720 --> 47:00.420
You mustn't spill a drop.

47:01.500 --> 47:08.820
If you do, your head may very well
fall from your shoulders.

47:14.370 --> 47:20.700
<i>In that moment, all of my
cells were screaming from fear.</i>

47:25.570 --> 47:27.170
<i>Compared to that...</i>

47:27.680 --> 47:30.970
<i>This punk is absolutely nothing.</i>

47:31.620 --> 47:35.170
<i>He may have gotten stronger,
but he's no match for an Upper Rank.</i>

47:36.050 --> 47:39.370
<i>Agatsuma Zenitsu is pathetic.</i>

47:39.680 --> 47:44.580
<i>Always bawling his eyes out
with no sense of dignity.</i>

47:45.170 --> 47:51.120
Help! I fell in a hole
and sprained my ankle!

47:52.090 --> 47:57.380
<i>And that bastard said we'd
have to be successors together.</i>

47:57.890 --> 47:59.860
Here, Kaigaku.

48:00.960 --> 48:02.420
Gramps!

48:03.710 --> 48:05.830
It's a bit big.

48:07.540 --> 48:10.520
<i>Does he see us as equals?</i>

48:12.540 --> 48:14.720
<i>We're not!</i>

48:16.830 --> 48:19.140
Everyone dies at some point!

48:19.650 --> 48:23.910
You and that old man are no exception!

48:25.280 --> 48:28.100
<i>I could only use the first form.</i>

48:28.990 --> 48:32.440
<i>And he could use everything
except the first form.</i>

48:34.750 --> 48:36.030
<i>So Gramps...</i>

48:36.760 --> 48:41.970
<i>Wanted us to be joint
successors to Thunder Breathing.</i>

48:44.100 --> 48:45.380
<i>When you...</i>

48:46.910 --> 48:50.180
<i>Became a demon, I wanted to deny it.</i>

48:54.250 --> 48:56.660
<i>Thunder Breathing, Second Form:</i>

48:57.480 --> 48:58.540
<i>Rice Spirit!</i>

49:01.210 --> 49:03.600
<i>Five consecutive strikes
in the blink of an eye.</i>

49:06.810 --> 49:08.710
You've eaten so many people!

49:08.880 --> 49:11.760
You can't even tell the difference
between right and wrong!

49:11.790 --> 49:14.210
Oh, I know the difference!

49:16.110 --> 49:17.120
What's wrong?

49:17.560 --> 49:20.370
You're the old man's favorite, right?

49:21.660 --> 49:27.040
Show me your prized technique, already!

49:30.910 --> 49:36.920
What's wrong?
Don't hesitate, just try hit me with it!

49:43.130 --> 49:44.720
<i>Thunder Breathing,</i>

49:47.040 --> 49:48.350
<i>First Form:</i>

49:50.520 --> 49:52.120
<i>Thunderclap and Flash!</i>

49:58.370 --> 50:03.280
A basic straight rush, seriously?

50:03.600 --> 50:05.120
Like I'd fall for that!

50:06.950 --> 50:10.000
<i>Thunder Breathing, Third Form:</i>

50:10.280 --> 50:11.920
<i>Thunder Swarm!</i>

50:17.700 --> 50:19.820
<i>A spinning wave attack!</i>

50:20.070 --> 50:21.340
What's wrong?

50:21.760 --> 50:23.650
Done already?

50:25.100 --> 50:26.970
<i>Thunder Breathing, First Form:</i>

50:27.300 --> 50:29.220
<i>Thunderclap and Flash, Eightfold!</i>

50:33.920 --> 50:35.800
How boring!

50:36.990 --> 50:39.920
<i>Thunder Breathing, Fifth Form:</i>

50:42.500 --> 50:43.550
<i>Heat Lightning!</i>

50:45.830 --> 50:50.860
How do my techniques taste when
infused with my Blood Demon Art?

50:51.630 --> 50:56.360
My attacks slash the skin
and burn the flesh!

50:57.510 --> 51:00.930
Those who acknowledge my
worth and accept me are right.

51:01.550 --> 51:04.690
Those who underestimate my
talent and regect me are wrong.

51:05.440 --> 51:08.560
Do you get it? This is my power!

51:09.560 --> 51:11.680
As a demon, I'm unstoppable!

51:12.190 --> 51:19.290
If this is all you can do,
you're no proper successor!

51:26.460 --> 51:30.180
So that's your answer?

51:32.090 --> 51:33.280
I knew it...

51:33.950 --> 51:35.580
I knew but...

51:41.120 --> 51:45.150
Zenitsu, this is the end!

51:45.350 --> 51:46.870
<i>Thunder Breathing,</i>

51:48.270 --> 51:49.340
<i>Sixth Form:</i>

51:58.570 --> 52:00.330
<i>Rumble and Flash!</i>

52:01.080 --> 52:04.580
My slashes will continue to
crack your body with each blow!

52:05.030 --> 52:08.550
My power will also begin to fry your brain!

52:08.800 --> 52:12.550
By becoming a demon,
I've perfected Thunder Breathing!

52:16.900 --> 52:18.300
I am special!

52:18.580 --> 52:20.030
Unlike you!

52:20.470 --> 52:22.370
Unlike any of you!

52:23.360 --> 52:26.430
That old man was wrong, after all.

52:31.330 --> 52:33.650
Learn from Kaigaku's example!

52:34.410 --> 52:36.960
Be more like your senior!

52:38.350 --> 52:42.310
The first form of Thunder Breathing is the
foundation for all the others, isn't it?

52:42.820 --> 52:47.270
If he can't even use the first form...

52:47.980 --> 52:51.270
Even if he masters the others,
it won't amount to much.

52:51.780 --> 52:55.740
Despite that, Kaigaku
still acts all high and mighty.

52:56.090 --> 52:58.110
He'll never become a Hashira.

52:58.430 --> 53:00.110
He'll probably die right away.

53:01.440 --> 53:03.180
What was that for?

53:05.090 --> 53:07.540
You hit someone who outranked you?

53:08.420 --> 53:10.790
Don't go causing problems!

53:11.490 --> 53:14.760
Just having you around is so embarrassing.

53:17.610 --> 53:21.730
<i>I know that you've always hated me.</i>

53:22.420 --> 53:24.320
<i>I hated you just as much.</i>

53:25.840 --> 53:29.390
<i>But deep down, I respected you.</i>

53:30.390 --> 53:33.290
<i>You always had the resolve to work hard.</i>

53:34.530 --> 53:38.040
<i>I was always several steps behind you.</i>

53:39.140 --> 53:41.410
<i>You were special, to me.</i>

53:43.230 --> 53:47.100
<i>Just as special as Gramps was.</i>

53:48.350 --> 53:51.520
<i>But that wasn't enough for you.</i>

53:52.620 --> 53:57.070
<i>You always gave off a dissatisfied sound.</i>

53:59.620 --> 54:04.040
<i>Your box of happiness
must have had a hole in it.</i>

54:05.760 --> 54:07.940
<i>Causing it to constantly spill out.</i>

54:09.860 --> 54:14.250
<i>If you never choose to plug that hole,
you'll never be satisfied.</i>

54:17.370 --> 54:18.250
<i>Gramps...</i>

54:19.250 --> 54:20.000
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

54:21.490 --> 54:25.620
<i>We went down separate paths.</i>

54:37.420 --> 54:39.040
<i>He still has strength?</i>

54:49.340 --> 54:50.310
What?

54:58.590 --> 55:01.460
I'm sorry, brother.

55:21.770 --> 55:24.540
<i>Thunder Breathing, Seventh Form:</i>

55:28.300 --> 55:30.050
<i>Flaming Thunder God!</i>

55:39.600 --> 55:40.800
<i>I didn't see that coming.</i>

55:41.510 --> 55:43.700
<i>What was that technique?</i>

55:44.500 --> 55:45.600
<i>It was way too fast!</i>

55:46.110 --> 55:47.820
<i>I've never heard of it!</i>

55:47.850 --> 55:49.050
<i>What did you use?</i>

55:49.950 --> 55:55.640
Damn it, I knew that old man favored you!

55:55.660 --> 55:58.590
He only taught you
that technique, didn't he?

55:59.040 --> 56:00.120
No.

56:02.870 --> 56:05.060
Gramps wasn't like that.

56:06.190 --> 56:08.490
That was mine.

56:09.500 --> 56:12.070
A form I created on my own.

56:13.510 --> 56:16.950
I hoped, someday...

56:17.820 --> 56:20.340
I would use it alongside you.

56:24.440 --> 56:26.390
<i>A seventh form?</i>

56:27.490 --> 56:30.800
<i>Thunder Breathing only has six forms.</i>

56:30.820 --> 56:32.700
<i>This guy created a seventh?</i>

56:33.990 --> 56:37.870
<i>Him? The guy who can
only use the first form?</i>

56:39.110 --> 56:41.670
<i>This dirt who is inferior to me?</i>

56:43.750 --> 56:48.750
<i>It can't be! I refuse to accept it!</i>

56:49.400 --> 56:52.600
<i>I'm about to lose to someone like him?</i>

56:54.060 --> 56:56.240
<i>It's gonna drive me insane!</i>

56:58.120 --> 56:58.970
<i>No.</i>

57:00.290 --> 57:01.900
<i>I'm not gonna lose.</i>

57:02.320 --> 57:04.190
<i>He's going to die from this fall.</i>

57:04.720 --> 57:07.070
<i>He doesn't have any strength left.</i>

57:08.220 --> 57:10.440
<i>This dirt is going to die with me.</i>

57:12.340 --> 57:16.190
Those who choose not to help others shouldn't
expect to receive anything in return.

57:18.440 --> 57:22.570
Those who only covet
will end up with nothing.

57:23.400 --> 57:25.920
Because they can't
make anything themselves.

57:27.820 --> 57:30.290
Dying alone sure is pathetic.

57:52.750 --> 57:53.720
Where am I?

58:02.650 --> 58:03.550
Gramps!

58:06.800 --> 58:10.240
I'm sorry, I couldn't
get along with Kaigaku!

58:10.750 --> 58:12.290
You'd constantly send me letters...

58:12.670 --> 58:14.830
But I'd always ignore your requests!

58:16.020 --> 58:20.100
If I wasn't around, Kaigaku probably
wouldn't have turned out how he did.

58:20.480 --> 58:22.620
I'm so sorry! Forgive me!

58:23.500 --> 58:25.700
I'm sorry for never repaying my debt!

58:26.350 --> 58:30.350
I just wanted you to see
me become a Hashira!

58:31.140 --> 58:32.070
I'm sorry!

58:32.510 --> 58:34.060
Gramps, I'm sorry!

58:38.110 --> 58:39.960
Do you hate me?

58:40.810 --> 58:43.010
Say something, Gramps!

58:45.310 --> 58:46.980
Damn! What are these?

58:47.010 --> 58:48.400
They're tangling around my feet!

58:49.930 --> 58:50.850
Gramps!

58:50.870 --> 58:51.580
I...

58:51.860 --> 58:52.510
I...

58:55.410 --> 58:56.080
Shit!

58:58.930 --> 59:00.410
Zenitsu...

59:08.040 --> 59:11.770
You're everything I could've hoped for.

59:35.100 --> 59:35.750
How is he?

59:36.070 --> 59:37.120
Can he be saved?

59:37.690 --> 59:39.070
I know this guy!

59:39.330 --> 59:40.720
Please do something!

59:41.000 --> 59:42.300
I'm begging you!

59:42.660 --> 59:44.580
Shut up already, Murata.

59:44.960 --> 59:49.830
Make yourself useful and keep an eye out.

59:51.550 --> 59:53.880
Hey, what's your rank?

59:53.900 --> 59:56.300
If it's lower than mine,
I won't forgive you!

59:56.970 --> 01:00:00.070
<i>Well, I'm a demon, so I don't have a rank.</i>

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:07.370
I'm using the demon styptic, but if these cracks
don't stop spreading, they'll rip his eyes apart.

01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:09.970
Can you hear me?

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.920
Don't say such things in front of him!

01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:20.520
I don't know what to do if
this doesn't stop the bleeding.

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:21.640
Stop it!

01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:23.940
You'll be fine for sure!
We're gonna save you!

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.510
You're not gonna die!

01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:26.820
Hang in there Agatsuma!

01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:28.370
Just hang in there!

01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:34.520
Thankfully that Upper Rank you
fought hadn't mastered its techniques.

01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:36.860
You've very lucky.

01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:41.020
If you fought him a year from now,
he would've killed you instantly.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.390
Stop saying such depressing things!

01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:56.700
I-I'm not saying anything wrong.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.350
What is it?

01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:03.170
Thanks to all that shouting,
a demon found us.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.540
Way to go.

01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:10.420
Hey, Yushiro, leave this to us.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.000
Get Agatsuma out of here!

01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:13.530
Let's go!

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:19.180
Hurry up and kill it already, Senpai.

01:01:19.210 --> 01:01:21.300
You'll pay for that later!

01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:22.130
Damn!

01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:26.830
<i>Water Breathing, Second Form:</i>

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:28.400
<i>Water Wheel!</i>

01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:32.650
Flank them!

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.270
Go around there!

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.520
<i>Oh no!</i>

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.350
<i>He's gonna...</i>

01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:59.770
<i>No Upper Ranks so far...</i>

01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:02.520
<i>Is Muzan still that far away?</i>

01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:04.750
<i>Are the others still alive?</i>

01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:12.030
<i>Shinobu-san, I swear we'll win!</i>

01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:15.270
<i>I'm sure everyone will...</i>

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:19.920
What's this shaking?

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:21.550
Giyu-san!

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:22.550
Stop!

01:02:23.330 --> 01:02:24.180
Stay calm!

01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:28.370
<i>Is someone fighting?</i>

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:30.880
<i>Is someone else gonna die?</i>

01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:40.990
<i>No, something is coming.</i>

01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:46.140
<i>This smell...</i>

01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:55.540
Above!

01:02:55.570 --> 01:02:56.480
Tanjiro, get back!

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.110
It's been a while.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:10.930
I'm surprised a weakling
like you is still alive.

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:15.130
Kamado Tanjiro!

01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:20.210
Akaza!

01:03:53.070 --> 01:04:01.400
<i>Inside of this flesh cocoon,
he's probably trying to break down my drug.</i>

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:09.000
<i>Kibutsuji Muzan, you must be destroyed.</i>

01:04:10.550 --> 01:04:13.630
<i>But how?</i>

01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:25.220
<i>Eventually, he'll absorb me too.</i>

01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:30.120
<i>Please somebody, come quick!</i>

01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:32.480
<i>Please!</i>

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:52.300
<i>My father's theory was that if Muzan dies,
all demons will die.</i>

01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:58.030
<i>But Kibutsuji Muzan is still alive.</i>

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:03.750
<i>Muzan's power must be suppressed by Tamayo-san.</i>

01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:09.450
<i>Because of that, I can't find
him with Yushiro-san's eyes.</i>

01:05:10.610 --> 01:05:16.210
<i>We must defeat Muzan
before he regains his strength.</i>

01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:23.390
<i>But in this infinitely expanding castle...</i>

01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:28.260
<i>Can we really find Kibutsuji Muzan?</i>

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.340
Don't rush.

01:05:36.450 --> 01:05:38.240
You're doing well.

01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:43.460
He'll show himself soon enough.

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:46.610
Just like how he came to me.

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:53.340
Kibutsuji Muzan is that kind of man.

01:05:59.490 --> 01:06:01.390
<i>Understood, Father.</i>

01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:04.010
<i>I'll find and defeat him.</i>

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:11.880
<i>Before the others' strength runs out.</i>

01:06:23.290 --> 01:06:24.810
Stand strong!

01:06:24.830 --> 01:06:29.520
We'll hold out, minimizing
the Hashira's exhaustion.

01:06:29.930 --> 01:06:32.200
Go on ahead!

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:34.680
Stone Hashira, hurry.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.120
You guys...

01:06:44.770 --> 01:06:47.120
Please, defeat Kibutsuji!

01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:48.420
Please!

01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:50.410
Understood.

01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:53.000
We'll leave this to you.

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:54.570
Tokito!

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.430
Now's our chance to show
off our Hashira Training!

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:10.880
<i>Thank you, everyone.</i>

01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:15.400
<i>Father, everyone's fighting hard.</i>

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:27.350
Don't cry.

01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:30.100
You cannot stop your hands.

01:07:30.930 --> 01:07:33.120
We cannot afford to lose.

01:07:35.070 --> 01:07:35.820
Right.

01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:42.100
Kiriya-sama is magnificent.

01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:49.500
Despite his anguish over his father's death,
he has taken over the Demon Slayer Corps.

01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:53.270
He's making sure to fulfill his mission.

01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:57.330
Eh, Rengoku-san?

01:07:58.930 --> 01:08:00.030
That's right.

01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:07.620
Despite their age, these kids
are rousing my confidence.

01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:11.080
Just as Kyojuro did.

01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:17.030
I refuse to bring shame upon
the Rengoku family name.

01:08:30.370 --> 01:08:32.990
<i>It looks like she's suffering.</i>

01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:39.780
<i>As the Master instructed, I gave her
the medicine given to me by Tamayo.</i>

01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:42.870
<i>I used it as I was told.</i>

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:50.100
<i>But can it really turn
Nezuko back into a human?</i>

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:56.860
<i>If Nezuko becomes human again,
Muzan's scheme will crumble.</i>

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:08.690
<i>His dream of conquering the Sun that he's pursued
for the last 1,000 years will return to square one.</i>

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:19.590
<i>In all that time, the only demon
to conquer the Sun is Nezuko.</i>

01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:40.650
<i>The words "the final phase"
keep crossing my mind.</i>

01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:49.240
<i>Every time, my body trembles
and my heart beats louder.</i>

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:54.960
<i>This long battle may finally end tonight.</i>

01:09:56.020 --> 01:10:00.290
<i>I never believed that I
would be alive to witness it.</i>

01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:02.820
<i>Tanjiro...</i>

01:10:03.610 --> 01:10:08.140
<i>Every since that day you
brought your demon sister to me...</i>

01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:14.810
<i>It's felt as if a large machine
has suddenly sprung to life.</i>

01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:22.660
<i>If everything up until this point was
represented by a giant piece of equipment...</i>

01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:29.060
<i>Then you and Nezuko
are the two small cogs...</i>

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:35.060
<i>That caused our stagnant
situation to begin moving.</i>

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.940
<i>Don't lose, Nezuko.</i>

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:45.020
<i>Don't lose, Tanjiro.</i>

01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:48.820
<i>You must not lose.</i>

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.080
<i>Hinokami Kagura:</i>

01:10:51.670 --> 01:10:52.620
<i>Fire Wheel!</i>

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:57.270
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:59.870
<i>If I can't cut his arm,
then there's no way I can cut his neck!</i>

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:07.710
<i>I got him.</i>

01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:09.510
<i>And I dodged his attack.</i>

01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:11.550
<i>This can work, I can fight!</i>

01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:15.210
<i>I couldn't aim for his head,
but this time...</i>

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:18.030
<i>Hinokami Kagura:</i>

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:19.100
<i>Fake Rainbow!</i>

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:35.690
<i>Tanjiro...</i>

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.640
<i>You've really improved your techniques...</i>

01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:44.780
<i>It wouldn't be unreasonable to say
your abilities rival that of a Hashira.</i>

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:48.810
<i>You're actually able to damage
someone like Upper Three.</i>

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.390
<i>That day...</i>

01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:02.650
<i>All you could do was fall to your
knees and bow your head in despair.</i>

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:05.480
<i>Begging me to spare your sister's life.</i>

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:15.810
<i>Now you can fight.</i>

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:21.780
<i>Neither your life nor your
dignity can be taken from you.</i>

01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:26.310
"This boy isn't weak."

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:28.200
"Don't insult him."

01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:32.550
Now I recognize the truth
behind Kyojuro's words.

01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:35.520
You're not weak.

01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:37.770
To show my respect...

01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:43.570
<i>Technique Development!</i>

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.750
Well, let's get this party started.

01:12:51.670 --> 01:12:53.670
It's time to have some fun.

01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:43.100
<i>Water Breathing, Third Form:</i>

01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:44.860
<i>Flowing Dance!</i>

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:47.770
A Water Hashira, huh?

01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:52.370
It's been about 50 years
since the last time I fought one!

01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:01.800
<i>Destructive Death:</i>

01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:03.290
<i>Disorder!</i>

01:14:05.610 --> 01:14:08.210
<i>Water Breathing, Eleventh Form:</i>

01:14:09.310 --> 01:14:09.940
<i>Dead Calm!</i>

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:17.730
I've never seen that technique before.

01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:22.610
The last Water Hashira
I killed never used it!

01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:24.660
<i>Hinokami Kagura:</i>

01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:26.280
<i>Raging Sun!</i>

01:14:28.690 --> 01:14:29.500
<i>He's gone!</i>

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:31.440
<i>Behind me!</i>

01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:33.140
<i>Hinokami Kagura:</i>

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:33.660
<i>Fak—</i>

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:36.980
<i>Water Breathing, Second Form:</i>

01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:38.760
<i>Water Wheel!</i>

01:14:51.650 --> 01:14:52.760
<i>Hinokami Kagura:</i>

01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:55.480
<i>Dance!</i>

01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:57.550
<i>Destructive Death, Leg Type:</i>

01:14:58.010 --> 01:14:59.450
<i>Crown Splitter!</i>

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:02.770
<i>I blocked it with my sword!</i>

01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:11.330
<i>He only grazed me, but with such force...</i>

01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:17.340
So elegant!

01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:22.980
Your sword skills are simply wonderful!

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.830
Give me your name!

01:15:25.850 --> 01:15:27.750
I want to remember you!

01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:32.660
I won't give my name to a demon.

01:15:32.690 --> 01:15:35.440
And I hate talking, so don't speak to me.

01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:40.200
Oh, you hate talking?

01:15:40.650 --> 01:15:42.740
Well, I <i>love</i> talking!

01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:46.970
I'll just keep asking for
your name until you tell me!

01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:56.480
<i>Destructive Death, Leg Type:</i>

01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:58.590
<i>Explosive Flurry!</i>

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:12.500
Giyu-san!

01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:18.670
I see! His name is Giyu?

01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:24.020
<i>Hinokami Kagura:</i>

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.250
<i>Destructive Death:</i>

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.240
<i>Eight-Layered Demon Core!</i>

01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:29.080
<i>Burning Bones, Summer Sun!</i>

01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:46.250
Nice moves.

01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:49.840
You must've trained hard
to reach this level so quickly.

01:16:50.450 --> 01:16:51.850
I can praise that.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:56.500
Even so, Kyojuro was
something else entirely.

01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:05.080
That night, all you could do was
lie on the ground looking pathetic.

01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:07.660
But look at you now!

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:11.660
Your growth is stunning!

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:13.910
I'm feeling pure joy!

01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:15.910
My heart is racing!

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:22.430
I'm glad Kyojuro died that night.

01:17:25.530 --> 01:17:29.080
I doubt he had much more room to grow.

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:34.530
All because his stupid values
made him want to stay human.

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:37.670
What did you say?

01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:46.310
You...

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:48.580
Don't dare to say another word.

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:54.730
Don't talk about Rengoku-san!

01:17:55.950 --> 01:17:59.460
Why? I'm praising you guys.

01:17:59.910 --> 01:18:03.450
Both you and Kyojuro.

01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:06.860
No, you're just casting insults.

01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:11.140
All you do is spit in the
face of everyone you fight.

01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:15.020
You don't understand, Tanjiro.

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:19.600
I only despise the weak.

01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:24.430
I only spit in the face of the weak.

01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:31.830
Yeah, weaklings make me vomit.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:37.680
The law of nature dictates
that they're to be eradicated.

01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:41.690
Everything you're saying is wrong.

01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:49.030
The fact that you're here is proof.

01:18:50.890 --> 01:18:53.290
Everyone is born weak.

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:56.150
Without someone to take
care of them, they can't live.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.790
You were the same, Akaza.

01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:06.590
You may not remember, but when you
were a baby, someone looked out for you.

01:19:07.290 --> 01:19:08.550
That's the only reason you're alive.

01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:16.350
The strong exist to protect the weak.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:21.840
Then the weak grow strong
and protect those weaker than themselves.

01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:24.750
<i>That</i> is the law of nature!

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:29.200
Akaza, your way of
thinking is unforgivable.

01:19:29.970 --> 01:19:33.200
I refuse to let you get
away with it any longer!

01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:40.190
<i>I get it.</i>

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:47.500
<i>By instinct, I just can't accept him.</i>

01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:51.890
<i>Even now that he's strong,
this feeling isn't going away.</i>

01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:01.220
Everybody starts out weak.

01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:04.940
Through assistance,
they gradually get stronger.

01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:08.620
Don't waste time
comparing yourself to others.

01:20:09.170 --> 01:20:16.970
What you should strive for is becoming a stronger
version of yourself than you were yesterday.

01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:23.420
If you keep that up for 10 to 20 years,
you'll become magnificent.

01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:28.410
And then it'll be your turn to assist.

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:37.140
<i>What?</i>

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:39.290
<i>Why'd he swing at that empty space?</i>

01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:50.330
Tanjiro, you really are unpleasant.

01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:54.020
<i>Destructive Death, Crushing Type:</i>

01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:56.420
<i>Ten Thousand Flashing Willow Leaves!</i>

01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:01.820
<i>He's incredibly fast!</i>

01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:08.360
<i>No, it's not just speed,
to be more precise, he's...</i>

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:14.850
<i>Destructive Death, Leg Type:</i>

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:20.030
<i>Flying Planet, Thousand Wheels!</i>

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:31.820
<i>Even if I could somehow predict his moves and
block his attacks, I wouldn't get away unscathed.</i>

01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:37.130
<i>His techniques feel like they're
drawn right to my openings.</i>

01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:44.820
<i>It's like there's a magnet
pulling his attacks to my vitals.</i>

01:21:45.450 --> 01:21:50.370
<i>How? What is he reacting to?</i>

01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:52.800
<i>Think back, remember.</i>

01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:59.230
<i>There must be something that I can
deduce from what he's said or done.</i>

01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:04.100
<i>Hinokami Kagura:</i>

01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:05.450
<i>Solar Heat Haze!</i>

01:22:16.650 --> 01:22:18.300
That's a fun technique!

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:22.230
It looked like your blade got longer.

01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:24.800
How'd you do that?

01:22:25.130 --> 01:22:28.250
The tip was wavering like heat haze.

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:29.400
How interesting!

01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:42.050
<i>Hinokami Kagura:</i>

01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:43.730
<i>Dance!</i>

01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:47.070
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:49.430
<i>It's gonna break!</i>

01:22:54.630 --> 01:22:56.320
Nice head-butt!

01:22:57.870 --> 01:23:00.050
<i>Let go! Let go! Let go!</i>

01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:05.250
<i>No good, he's not letting go!</i>

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:18.590
Giyu-san!

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:24.630
Now I'm angry.

01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:27.650
There's a searing pain in my back.

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:33.570
You really sent me flying, Upper Three.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:40.800
<i>I rarely feel the need to weild
my sword to the best of my ability.</i>

01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:45.300
<i>And never is it for any
sort of entertainment.</i>

01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:52.000
<i>But right now, for the first time I'm standing
before an opponent who can overwhelm me.</i>

01:23:52.330 --> 01:23:55.820
<i>And I realize just how sharply
his senses have been honed.</i>

01:23:57.450 --> 01:24:01.480
<i>In that moment,
I felt something inside of me awaken.</i>

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:07.420
<i>I was being dragged into the
same realm my opponent was in.</i>

01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:13.100
<i>And I realized how a matter of life
and death can push one past their limit.</i>

01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:17.930
Giyu-san...

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.990
<i>His speed is...</i>

01:24:38.010 --> 01:24:39.070
Insane!

01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:45.920
<i>Water Breathing, Fourth Form:</i>

01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:47.040
<i>Striking Tide!</i>

01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:03.340
<i>They're both so fast!</i>

01:25:03.790 --> 01:25:08.520
<i>But Akaza immediately adapted
to Giyu-san's increased speed.</i>

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:13.420
Is this all you've got?

01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:25.890
More! Hit me harder!

01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:56.130
<i>Tenth Form:</i>

01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:58.300
<i>Constant Flux!</i>

01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:17.170
<i>Seventh Form:</i>

01:26:17.190 --> 01:26:18.880
<i>Drop Ripple Thrust!</i>

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:20.440
<i>Destructive Death:</i>

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:21.870
<i>Disorder!</i>

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:33.670
<i>Giyu-san!</i>

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:35.080
<i>Akaza!</i>

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.530
<i>Calm down!</i>

01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:44.620
<i>Think, don't panic.</i>

01:26:45.170 --> 01:26:46.950
<i>Never cast aside your thoughts.</i>

01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:52.400
<i>Why are Akaza's attacks
so accurate in the first place?</i>

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:57.350
<i>How is he able to react to attacks
coming from his blind spots?</i>

01:26:58.750 --> 01:26:59.700
<i>Think!</i>

01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:06.980
Your fighting spirit has
been honed to the hilt.

01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:09.340
It's close to the realm of the highest.

01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:17.710
<i>In his fight with Rengoku-san,
Akaza mentioned "fighting spirit."</i>

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:21.160
<i>What is fighting spirit?</i>

01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:27.780
<i>Just like how I'm able to sense things by smell,
can Akaza sense things by fighting spirit?</i>

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:46.230
It kinda tingles wherever on
my body an enemy is looking.

01:27:46.710 --> 01:27:49.700
So that's how you were able
to react to Gyutaro's attack.

01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:52.060
Even though it was from behind.

01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:56.870
My skin is stronger
than a human's after all!

01:27:57.380 --> 01:28:01.800
It doesn't matter if it's from behind!
If someone even looks at me I can tell!

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:03.370
Can you show me?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.080
Sure thing!

01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:12.710
You're looking at my right shoulder.

01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:14.370
Wow, you're right!

01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:18.880
If someone looks at me with murderous intent,
I'm able to tell immediately!

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:22.150
After all, if something's trying
to hurt me, I should know!

01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:26.400
It stabs into my skin and
makes me sting all over!

01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:28.430
<i>That's right</i>

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:33.930
<i>Inosuke's able to sense things
that are invisible to the eye.</i>

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.570
<i>What else did he say about it?</i>

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:39.730
<i>Back then?</i>

01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:46.480
But if someone doesn't have bad intentions,
it's freakin' hard to notice them!

01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:48.750
Like that damn old hag!

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.930
That old hag at the Wisteria House
was really freaky.

01:28:54.210 --> 01:28:56.000
She'd just appear...

01:28:58.090 --> 01:29:01.200
Right behind me with rice balls somehow!

01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.140
It's impolite to call her "old hag."

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:05.320
Say "old lady."

01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:06.430
Old lady hag!

01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:07.190
Hey!

01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:15.190
So I figure if I can get close to my enemies
while hiding my hostility, I'll be unkillable!

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:22.500
But that's probably because she
had no intention of harming you at all.

01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:27.160
I think it would be impossible to kill a
demon without showing any hostility.

01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:31.410
I guess that's true.

01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:37.530
An attack without any intent behind it
wouldn't cut through a demon's neck.

01:29:39.130 --> 01:29:43.800
<i>It was a silly conversation but maybe
there's something I can take from it.</i>

01:29:46.330 --> 01:29:49.650
<i>What is it that Akaza can sense?</i>

01:29:49.950 --> 01:29:52.970
<i>Is fighting spirit different
from murderous intent?</i>

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:54.870
<i>The will to fight?</i>

01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:57.750
<i>How much or how hard you've trained?</i>

01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:02.390
Is it similar to how I can
predict moves by smell?

01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:07.940
Could there be some way to
throw off Akaza's Compass Needle?

01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:19.550
<i>Hinokami Kagura:</i>

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:20.300
<i>Dance!</i>

01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:26.970
Your body's wide open, Tanjiro!

01:30:30.370 --> 01:30:31.120
<i>Now!</i>

01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:45.150
<i>Fighting spirit...</i>

01:30:45.630 --> 01:30:46.280
<i>Magnet...</i>

01:30:46.850 --> 01:30:47.910
<i>Compass Needle...</i>

01:30:48.850 --> 01:30:49.650
<i>Instinct...</i>

01:30:50.250 --> 01:30:50.950
<i>Hostility...</i>

01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:52.080
<i>The realm...</i>

01:30:53.250 --> 01:30:54.860
<i>Of the highest...</i>

01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:57.100
<i>I see!</i>

01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:00.300
That's it!

01:31:18.190 --> 01:31:22.540
Dad, what do you think about when
you perform the Hinokami Kagura?

01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:26.970
If it's too hard for you,
I can take your place next year.

01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:29.860
I'm worried about your health.

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:33.550
Thank you, Tanjiro.

01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:39.470
But in all the years that I have performed
the kagura, it's never been difficult.

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:42.470
It's quite strange.

01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:49.890
When I learned the kagura from your grandfather,
I was younger and healthier than I am now.

01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:53.060
But I found myself out of breath very fast.

01:31:57.090 --> 01:32:01.860
<i>Every Near Year for generations,
my family has performed our kagura.</i>

01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:07.610
<i>It's a demanding dance that is
performed from sunrise to sunset.</i>

01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:11.080
<i>There are 12 stages in total.</i>

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:15.790
<i>And by dawn, each stage will have
been repeated hundreds of times.</i>

01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:22.740
I figured it was because early on,
I had a lot of wasted movements.

01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:28.170
What's important is to maintain
proper control of your breathing.

01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:33.160
And to exert the maximum strength
possible with as little motion.

01:32:33.810 --> 01:32:38.640
If you do that, your mind
slowly becomes invisible.

01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:41.390
Invisible?

01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:49.510
As your learning, you need to etch each
movement and sensation into your body.

01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:57.250
Utilize your senses to become conscious of
you entire body, down to the blood vessels.

01:32:59.970 --> 01:33:02.280
This period is the most strenuous.

01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:07.400
You might even start thinking
that you'll never get any better.

01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:14.530
After you've taught your body the motions,
remove the pieces that are unnecessary.

01:33:15.310 --> 01:33:18.450
Leave only what is absolutely required.

01:33:19.050 --> 01:33:20.280
Then close yourself.

01:33:21.730 --> 01:33:22.500
Close?

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:27.500
When people try to listen closely,
they close their eyes.

01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:34.830
Just like that, only focus on
what is necessary in the moment.

01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:40.500
Given time, you'll learn to
close off individual blood vessels.

01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:45.030
Becoming able to perform the
motions as easily as blinking.

01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:51.500
Then you'll see the
path enshrined by light.

01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:59.110
When your mind becomes invisible,
you begin to see the Transparent World.

01:34:00.130 --> 01:34:06.510
But this domain can only be reached after
you've pushed yourself to the absolute limit.

01:34:07.150 --> 01:34:08.750
Can I see it?

01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:13.050
Only if you keep working hard.

01:34:14.210 --> 01:34:16.000
Here, they're done.

01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:17.030
Thanks!

01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:23.570
<i>Ten days before my father died...</i>

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:28.450
<i>There was an incident on the other side of
the mountain where a bear attacked people.</i>

01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:34.880
<i>We lit fires and hung ropes
with bells around the entire house.</i>

01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:54.890
Tanjiro.

01:34:59.670 --> 01:35:00.370
Yes?

01:35:02.150 --> 01:35:02.970
Come with me.

01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:55.080
I'm sorry that you're hungry.

01:35:55.530 --> 01:35:58.270
But I will not let you come any closer.

01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:05.520
I'll show no mercy to anything
that tries to harm my family.

01:36:06.230 --> 01:36:08.300
Heed my warning...

01:36:11.650 --> 01:36:13.950
Or I will take your life.

01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:32.350
<i>The bear's head, as big as a small child,
fell to the gound at a sound of a bell.</i>

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:41.120
<i>I couldn't follow it with my eyes, but I think my
father slashed the bear twice in the span of a blink.</i>

01:36:43.770 --> 01:36:48.020
<i>Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to cut
off its head with that small of a hatchet.</i>

01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:55.240
<i>The entire time,
my father's scent did not change.</i>

01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:58.560
<i>He just stood there.</i>

01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:08.040
Did you see that?

01:37:09.570 --> 01:37:11.880
Never forget what you just saw.

01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:18.690
<i>My father wasn't the type of
person to show off his strength.</i>

01:37:19.770 --> 01:37:25.570
Later, I realized that he
was teaching me a lesson.

01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:31.600
<i>He was teaching me how someone
who sees the Transparent World moves.</i>

01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:40.760
<i>The same way his father, grandfather,
great-grandfather, was taught.</i>

01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:45.160
Never give up.

01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:47.560
Keep your focus on it.

01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:53.700
If you keep trying,
you can scale any obstacle effortlessly.

01:37:55.820 --> 01:37:57.360
<i>I know, Father.</i>

01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:03.840
<i>That's why a moment ago, I
was able to dodge Akaza's attack.</i>

01:38:07.170 --> 01:38:11.420
<i>That hit alone probably would've killed me.</i>

01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:17.010
<i>Right now, me and Giyu-san are
alternating between offense and defense.</i>

01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:20.750
<i>I may have been able to
dodge that fatal attack...</i>

01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:27.650
<i>But Giyu-san couldn't make
it in that time he was open.</i>

01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:31.890
<i>For some reason,
I didn't think I dodged in time.</i>

01:38:32.670 --> 01:38:39.660
<i>Just for a moment I think
that I entered that world.</i>

01:38:44.610 --> 01:38:46.340
<i>The Transparent World.</i>

01:38:49.060 --> 01:38:51.570
<i>I could see through his body...</i>

01:38:53.250 --> 01:38:56.830
<i>It was the same as how I knew Hantengu
was hiding inside of his own heart.</i>

01:38:57.650 --> 01:38:59.880
<i>I don't know if I actually
saw it or if I smelled it.</i>

01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:05.920
<i>Dodge.</i>

01:39:06.570 --> 01:39:09.120
<i>I was so focused on that,
I closed off my other senses.</i>

01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:13.280
<i>And my body moved faster than ever.</i>

01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:18.530
<i>That was the world my father showed me.</i>

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:21.970
<i>The speed at which I could
move increased drastically.</i>

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:28.630
<i>I was able to observe the
flow of blood and oxygen.</i>

01:39:29.330 --> 01:39:34.050
<i>Also, I could see exactly
which muscles were contracting.</i>

01:39:38.420 --> 01:39:44.480
<i>If I close off my fighting spirit,
I might be able to go for Akaza's neck.</i>

01:39:58.070 --> 01:40:00.680
<i>Watch closely...</i>

01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:07.650
It looks like you've
shown me all of your forms.

01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:13.710
That's enough, Giyu.
It's time I end this.

01:40:13.730 --> 01:40:16.330
I'm amazed by how long
you've been able to keep up!

01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:19.100
<i>You're kidding!</i>

01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:21.870
<i>Somehow he broke my blade...</i>

01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:25.530
<i>From the side...</i>

01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:28.730
<i>I was swinging down...</i>

01:40:29.850 --> 01:40:30.880
Farewell.

01:41:00.970 --> 01:41:03.880
<i>He cut his arm in
the middle of the attack.</i>

01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:07.550
<i>His breathing sounds different,
his eyes too...</i>

01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:11.130
<i>Tanjiro saved me.</i>

01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:20.030
<i>Every cell in my body is telling me
that I need to kill this kid right now.</i>

01:41:21.730 --> 01:41:24.450
<i>Something about him changed.</i>

01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:27.320
<i>He's dangerous!</i>

01:41:29.150 --> 01:41:33.500
<i>He's completely focused on Tanjiro...</i>

01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:41.480
<i>Technique Development, Final Form:</i>

01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:44.000
<i>Blue Silver Chaotic Afterglow!</i>

01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:51.610
<i>His attack power and speed
is increasing even more!</i>

01:41:52.230 --> 01:41:55.080
<i>Can I even withstand this with Dead Calm?</i>

01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:20.020
<i>This is the place my
father was talking about.</i>

01:42:20.630 --> 01:42:24.200
<i>This is the Transparent World!</i>

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:38.000
<i>What's this? It's so strange.
Is time passing slowly?</i>

01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:44.680
Or are movements just slower?

01:42:51.330 --> 01:42:52.450
<i>It's inescapable!</i>

01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:56.180
<i>He let out 100 blows at
once from every direction!</i>

01:42:56.570 --> 01:43:00.670
<i>Even with Dead Calm,
I couldn't block them all.</i>

01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:06.750
I'm impressed you're
still alive after that.

01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:10.100
Somehow you dodged all the fatal blows.

01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:14.800
Don't die like Kyojuro and Tanjiro.

01:43:15.140 --> 01:43:17.800
Become a demon, Giyu.

01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:21.510
<i>He doesn't notice?</i>

01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:25.930
<i>Tanjiro survived the attack, too!</i>

01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:28.120
<i>Wait...</i>

01:43:29.100 --> 01:43:33.060
<i>Tanjiro, now's your chance
if you can still move!</i>

01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:36.620
<i>Before he realizes, go for his neck!</i>

01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:40.820
Akaza! I'm going to cut off your head!

01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:48.920
<i>Idiot! Don't call out to him!</i>

01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:51.520
<i>He's alive?</i>

01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:56.350
<i>How was he able to survive my final form?</i>

01:43:56.670 --> 01:43:58.560
<i>No, it doesn't matter.</i>

01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:02.920
<i>My Compass Needle will
detect any attack he throws at me.</i>

01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:09.420
<i>The stronger his fighting spirit,
the easier it is to respond.</i>

01:44:12.970 --> 01:44:17.470
<i>What? What is this odd presence?</i>

01:44:18.270 --> 01:44:22.270
<i>It's like he's become a different creature entirely!</i>

01:44:24.030 --> 01:44:26.010
<i>His fighting spirit is gone!</i>

01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:27.330
<i>He has no fighting spirit!</i>

01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:29.250
<i>Stay calm!</i>

01:44:29.770 --> 01:44:30.450
<i>It's coming!</i>

01:44:37.230 --> 01:44:38.800
<i>Hinokami Kagura:</i>

01:44:39.450 --> 01:44:40.950
<i>Setting Sun Transformation!</i>

01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:05.310
<i>No way!</i>

01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:18.520
<i>In all the time I've been alive, I've never
once seen a human without a fighting spirit.</i>

01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:22.300
<i>Even a baby will emit
a faint fighting spirit.</i>

01:45:23.230 --> 01:45:29.330
<i>But this guy managed to somehow
make his fighting spirit disappear.</i>

01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:37.480
<i>It was like facing a tree that
shouldn't have even been there.</i>

01:45:37.730 --> 01:45:39.820
<i>My senses were beyond confused.</i>

01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:42.850
<i>My compass wasn't responding.</i>

01:45:45.670 --> 01:45:47.970
<i>But that shouldn't have been a problem.</i>

01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:57.070
<i>In battle, you must be able to understand and
take care of anything that's being thrown at you.</i>

01:45:57.630 --> 01:45:59.600
<i>I've always been able to do that.</i>

01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:02.650
<i>Or so I thought...</i>

01:46:04.370 --> 01:46:11.330
<i>But, in the span of this fight, he managed to
grasp something and surpass even my speed...</i>

01:46:12.290 --> 01:46:18.530
<i>He came at me head-on and completely
demolished my centuries of training.</i>

01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:26.680
<i>In his eyes, there was no hatred,
anger, or even a will to fight.</i>

01:46:27.650 --> 01:46:34.700
<i>Perhaps the thing captured in his eyes was the
realm of the highest that I've been seeking.</i>

01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:45.820
<i>I always had this vague
feeling that such a thing existed...</i>

01:46:46.710 --> 01:46:50.550
<i>But I thought that since I'd never
reached it, it must not.</i>

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:03.390
<i>Not yet! I can still fight!</i>

01:47:03.790 --> 01:47:06.160
<i>I can still get stronger!</i>

01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:15.360
<i>He's trying to reattach his head!</i>

01:47:24.710 --> 01:47:26.210
<i>It can't...</i>

01:47:28.420 --> 01:47:29.990
<i>End like this...</i>

01:47:33.190 --> 01:47:34.980
<i>I can still get stronger...</i>

01:47:38.050 --> 01:47:40.710
<i>I must become stronger than anyone!</i>

01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:42.920
<i>Strength...</i>

01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:48.360
<i>Even stronger...</i>

01:47:58.220 --> 01:47:59.120
<i>He's down!</i>

01:47:59.810 --> 01:48:00.640
<i>It's over!</i>

01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:03.900
<i>We won!</i>

01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:10.520
<i>I'm so dizzy...</i>

01:48:12.870 --> 01:48:14.150
<i>My muscles are shaking...</i>

01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:16.710
<i>My body's reached its limit...</i>

01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:21.320
You okay, Tanjiro...

01:48:23.110 --> 01:48:25.440
<i>His body isn't crumbling...</i>

01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:28.460
<i>How? How is this...</i>

01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:29.520
Tan—

01:48:41.090 --> 01:48:43.690
<i>He's still moving! He's not going down!</i>

01:48:44.260 --> 01:48:46.230
<i>His neck is healing!</i>

01:48:49.710 --> 01:48:51.240
<i>My head is spinning!</i>

01:49:04.330 --> 01:49:06.440
<i>No... No way...</i>

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:08.630
<i>I cut off his head, but he's not dying!</i>

01:49:09.490 --> 01:49:12.540
<i>Is there some kinda special
condition like with Gyutaro?</i>

01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:16.050
<i>No, his head fell off and disappeared...</i>

01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:21.270
<i>Right now, Akaza is trying to...</i>

01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:32.550
<i>Just like Muzan,
he's trying to regrow his own head!</i>

01:49:33.650 --> 01:49:37.370
This fight isn't over, I need to...

01:49:38.210 --> 01:49:38.990
Tanjiro!

01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:40.510
<i>He passed out!</i>

01:49:41.190 --> 01:49:42.210
<i>Of course...</i>

01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:44.610
<i>He's way past his limit...</i>

01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:57.750
<i>Water Breathing, Fourth Form:</i>

01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:01.670
<i>Striking Tide!</i>

01:50:07.150 --> 01:50:11.610
<i>His regeneration is so fast,
despite losing his head!</i>

01:50:35.970 --> 01:50:38.280
<i>I can't hear anything in my left ear...</i>

01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:40.350
<i>There's no feeling in my right side...</i>

01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:44.990
<i>Can I even still grip my sword?</i>

01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:55.310
Hold it!

01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:57.340
I...

01:50:58.350 --> 01:51:00.700
I'm still alive...

01:51:02.070 --> 01:51:05.910
If you want to kill Tanjiro,
you'll have to kill me first!

01:51:10.530 --> 01:51:12.580
<i>An unwavering resolve.</i>

01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:16.680
<i>One that never bends,
no matter the obstacle in its way.</i>

01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:22.400
<i>We are not samurai, we do not carry swords.</i>

01:51:22.930 --> 01:51:25.840
<i>But we carry weapons in our hearts.</i>

01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:30.300
But we carry weapons in our hearts.

01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:34.890
Our only weapon is our fists.

01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:39.720
<i>What a nuisance!</i>

01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:51.680
Stop.

01:51:58.150 --> 01:51:59.260
<i>Who's that?</i>

01:52:05.420 --> 01:52:08.820
Hakuji-san, that's enough.

01:52:12.230 --> 01:52:13.310
<i>Let go.</i>

01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:15.320
<i>Let go of me.</i>

01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:17.990
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:52:20.370 --> 01:52:25.310
Stop this, let's leave this place.

01:52:26.730 --> 01:52:27.610
<i>I can't.</i>

01:52:28.340 --> 01:52:31.230
<i>I have to kill these people.</i>

01:52:33.110 --> 01:52:34.760
Why?

01:52:35.730 --> 01:52:38.630
<i>I must become stronger.</i>

01:52:39.620 --> 01:52:42.050
<i>And kill anyone who gets in my way.</i>

01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:45.190
But why?

01:52:46.230 --> 01:52:48.900
Why do you want to be strong?

01:52:51.050 --> 01:52:52.020
<i>Because...</i>

01:52:53.190 --> 01:52:54.790
<i>If I'm not strong...</i>

01:52:55.240 --> 01:52:58.050
<i>I can't bring it back...</i>

01:53:00.610 --> 01:53:02.760
<i>That medicine for my father.</i>

01:53:04.990 --> 01:53:07.020
<i>If I'm not strong...</i>

01:53:09.530 --> 01:53:13.200
<i>I can't run away after I steal a wallet.</i>

01:53:14.770 --> 01:53:18.780
<i>If I'm not strong, I can't win
when my victims retaliate.</i>

01:53:20.070 --> 01:53:25.390
<i>If I'm not strong, I can't withstand
the beating from the magistrate.</i>

01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:32.800
You now have three lines on both arms.

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:35.680
Next time, we'll cut off a hand.

01:53:44.110 --> 01:53:45.920
Silence!

01:53:46.370 --> 01:53:48.020
Go ahead and do it!

01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:53.290
If you cut my hands, I've still got feet!

01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:56.220
Either way, you're not
catching me next time!

01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:02.090
Repeated crimes at the mere age of eleven.

01:54:02.820 --> 01:54:07.660
Even a grown man would faint,
after receiving the lashings you've been given.

01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:10.690
You are a demon!

01:54:11.010 --> 01:54:12.800
Say whatever you want!

01:54:13.060 --> 01:54:15.360
That's right, I'm a demon!

01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:19.090
After all, they say I was born with fangs!

01:54:19.110 --> 01:54:21.140
Silence, you brat!

01:54:21.410 --> 01:54:23.810
"Demon" suits me just fine!

01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:35.140
Hakuji!

01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:37.130
Hakuji!

01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:42.760
When he heard you got arrested again,
your father hung himself!

01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:45.830
He's dead!

01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:52.590
Hakuji...

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:55.990
You can live an honest life.

01:54:56.920 --> 01:54:58.630
I'm sorry for the trouble.

01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:11.280
<i>Are the poor not even allowed to live?</i>

01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:17.570
<i>Dad...</i>

01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:23.510
<i>To hell with this world...</i>

01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:30.800
<i>To hell with every last one of them!</i>

01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:38.010
<i>Why do you pieces of shit get to live on?</i>

01:55:38.370 --> 01:55:41.050
<i>Why did my father have to die?</i>

01:55:42.150 --> 01:55:44.130
<i>He wasn't any trouble...</i>

01:55:44.350 --> 01:55:46.110
<i>What did he apologize for?</i>

01:55:46.850 --> 01:55:49.830
<i>My father didn't do anything wrong!</i>

01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:56.230
<i>I could take any punishment...</i>

01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:03.790
<i>They could whip me all they wanted,
but I'd withstand it all for your sake!</i>

01:56:03.810 --> 01:56:06.470
Repent! Find a job!

01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:09.800
<i>I don't wanna hear it!</i>

01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:14.830
<i>I wouldn't be able to make enough
money to afford his medicine!</i>

01:56:16.450 --> 01:56:19.600
<i>My father's health was rapidly declining.</i>

01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:24.100
<i>His ribs were showing through his back.</i>

01:56:24.730 --> 01:56:27.650
<i>I was sure with enough care, he would heal!</i>

01:56:30.260 --> 01:56:32.480
<i>I would've died in his place.</i>

01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:36.930
<i>For my father!</i>

01:56:43.590 --> 01:56:46.830
<i>For my father!</i>

01:56:55.530 --> 01:56:58.180
Oh, that was impressive.

01:56:58.810 --> 01:57:02.050
I came because people said they
were killing a child in the street.

01:57:02.530 --> 01:57:05.420
But you managed to knock
them all out, bare handed!

01:57:06.370 --> 01:57:08.400
You've got promise!

01:57:08.860 --> 01:57:11.750
You beat adults without a weapon!

01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:14.660
You're really impressive!

01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:18.920
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

01:57:19.550 --> 01:57:21.220
<i>What am I seeing?</i>

01:57:22.570 --> 01:57:24.390
<i>Are these my memories?</i>

01:57:24.930 --> 01:57:26.690
Wanna come to my dojo?

01:57:27.050 --> 01:57:28.900
I don't have any students.

01:57:29.670 --> 01:57:31.200
Shut up, old man!

01:57:31.390 --> 01:57:32.480
I'll kill you!

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:36.470
Those tattoos mean you're a criminal.

01:57:37.210 --> 01:57:41.330
Were you banished from
where you're originally from?

01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:43.650
So what if I was?

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.310
It's got nothing to do with you!

01:57:47.590 --> 01:57:49.640
It's time for you to be reformed.

01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:51.910
Come on!

01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:57.120
Drop dead, old man!

01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:18.740
Whew, you sure are tough!

01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:23.660
Despite that beating,
you woke up in less than an hour!

01:58:24.710 --> 01:58:25.990
I'm Keizo.

01:58:26.620 --> 01:58:30.760
I run a dojo that teaches the
barefisted style called Soryu.

01:58:31.510 --> 01:58:33.810
I don't have any students.

01:58:34.690 --> 01:58:38.180
So I make a living as a handyman.

01:58:41.090 --> 01:58:45.750
The first task I have for you
is to nurse my sick daughter.

01:58:46.590 --> 01:58:49.220
I have some work, so I'll leave her to you.

01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:54.920
My wife grew exhausted of nursing her,
and drowned herself in the river.

01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:58.040
So, it's been hard.

01:59:02.340 --> 01:59:04.720
The truth is, I'm too weak willed.

01:59:05.290 --> 01:59:07.460
I couldn't be of any
help to either of them.

01:59:10.530 --> 01:59:15.210
Are you sure you wanna leave your
daughter alone with a criminal like me?

01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:22.700
I just reformed that criminal
a while ago, so it's fine!

01:59:26.060 --> 01:59:27.430
<i>They're similar.</i>

01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:36.700
<i>I get it.</i>

01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:41.510
<i>I know why I find you so unpleasant.</i>

01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:46.120
<i>It's because you remind
me of my tiresome past.</i>

01:59:51.400 --> 01:59:53.570
This is my daughter, Koyuki.

01:59:56.750 --> 01:59:58.540
<i>This worthless past...</i>

02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:04.040
<i>Worthless...</i>

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:16.170
Hakuji, I'm sorry.

02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:19.360
Hey there, Koyuki.

02:00:21.890 --> 02:00:23.080
Are you feeling better?

02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:31.040
You certainly look better
than you did this morning.

02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:36.540
Oh, this guy...

02:00:37.070 --> 02:00:41.670
He won't tell me his name,
no matter how much I ask.

02:00:42.350 --> 02:00:44.170
Don't just stand there!

02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:47.040
Sit down.

02:00:49.170 --> 02:00:51.820
Try to force it out of
him before I get back!

02:01:03.670 --> 02:01:04.430
Um...

02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:08.210
Your face...

02:01:09.170 --> 02:01:09.960
It's bruised...

02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:12.150
Are you okay?

02:01:15.770 --> 02:01:19.040
<i>I'll definitely help you.</i>

02:01:19.370 --> 02:01:20.310
Protect you...

02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:25.960
<i>My life was filled with broken promises.</i>

02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:28.170
<i>It's comical.</i>

02:01:44.950 --> 02:01:46.540
Thank you...

02:01:48.230 --> 02:01:50.300
You don't have to say anything.

02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:52.700
Don't worry about it, just sleep.

02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:55.650
I'm sorry...

02:01:56.430 --> 02:01:57.880
For being a burden...

02:01:58.470 --> 02:01:59.750
It's fine.

02:02:02.310 --> 02:02:04.510
Should I close the door?

02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:08.780
This is fine...

02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:14.020
<i>Koyuki had a very frail body.</i>

02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:17.410
<i>I had to stay by her bed every night.</i>

02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:21.250
<i>Since she needed new
clothes and bedding frequently.</i>

02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:23.640
<i>She needed to drink a lot of water, too.</i>

02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:28.510
<i>So of course, I'd have to
carry her to the restroom.</i>

02:02:32.260 --> 02:02:35.840
<i>I had nursed my father in the same manner.</i>

02:02:36.430 --> 02:02:41.600
<i>So my body was used to the toll it took.</i>

02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:48.740
I'm sorry, again...

02:02:55.960 --> 02:03:00.490
<i>Why do sick people always
feel the need to apologize?</i>

02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:04.070
<i>"I'm sorry for the hassle."</i>

02:03:04.590 --> 02:03:07.150
<i>"I'm sorry for coughing too loud."</i>

02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:10.870
<i>"I'm sorry I can't get any work done."</i>

02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:15.410
<i>They must want to do things themselves.</i>

02:03:16.290 --> 02:03:17.830
<i>They must want to stop coughing.</i>

02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:20.530
<i>They must want to at
least breathe normally.</i>

02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:25.730
<i>They're the ones suffering, so why?</i>

02:03:28.930 --> 02:03:30.850
I'm sorry, again...

02:03:31.570 --> 02:03:35.540
Because of me, you can't train...

02:03:36.150 --> 02:03:38.260
Or even have any fun...

02:03:39.330 --> 02:03:42.490
I never think about having fun.

02:03:43.730 --> 02:03:46.470
And I have enough time to train as is.

02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:47.600
Don't worry about it.

02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:50.380
But...

02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:54.170
Sometimes you need a break from all this...

02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:58.000
There will be fireworks tonight...

02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:00.060
You should go...

02:04:01.770 --> 02:04:08.850
Maybe if you're up for it I can carry you to the bridge
and we can watch them together.

02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:19.240
If we can't go today, there'll be fireworks
next year and the year after that.

02:04:19.700 --> 02:04:21.650
We can go then, instead.

02:04:30.530 --> 02:04:39.020
<i>The only thing I didn't like about nursing her was that
she'd start crying in the middle of a conversation.</i>

02:04:40.250 --> 02:04:42.620
<i>I suppose being sick must be depressing.</i>

02:04:43.330 --> 02:04:46.260
<i>But when she cried,
it made me uncomfortable.</i>

02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:03.880
Oh, I see!

02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:09.440
The "haku"in Hakuji comes
from the "koma" in Komainu*.

02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:09.440
*Komainu are guardian statues at shrines

02:05:09.910 --> 02:05:12.000
You're the same as me after all.

02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:15.080
There's something you have to protect.

02:05:15.710 --> 02:05:18.750
Just like a Komainu protecting a shrine.

02:05:24.440 --> 02:05:30.230
<i>My master wasn't a samurai,
but he was still able to secure this land and dojo.</i>

02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:34.280
<i>Apparently, he saved
an old man from bandits.</i>

02:05:34.790 --> 02:05:38.120
<i>The old man was so fascinated
by his Soryu technique...</i>

02:05:38.630 --> 02:05:43.490
<i>That he handed over his
land and old dojo to my master.</i>

02:05:46.690 --> 02:05:52.860
<i>However, there were others who
wanted that land and dojo for themselves.</i>

02:05:53.480 --> 02:05:58.340
<i>A neighboring dojo began
harassing his Soryu dojo.</i>

02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:04.750
<i>Because of that, his dojo was
never able to keep any students around.</i>

02:06:12.350 --> 02:06:16.930
<i>But his lessons and nursing Koyuki...</i>

02:06:18.480 --> 02:06:21.280
<i>Saved my soul.</i>

02:06:40.860 --> 02:06:44.450
<i>After three years I turned 18.</i>

02:06:45.730 --> 02:06:52.690
<i>Koyuki turned 16 and was healthy enough
to get up and move around completely on her own.</i>

02:06:57.440 --> 02:06:59.250
Hakuji, come here.

02:07:00.290 --> 02:07:00.980
Okay.

02:07:03.110 --> 02:07:07.640
Will you take over my dojo, Hakuji?

02:07:08.460 --> 02:07:11.360
You also have my
blessing to be with Koyuki.

02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:24.870
<i>I'd been branded as a criminal...</i>

02:07:25.380 --> 02:07:27.430
<i>I never imagined a future for myself...</i>

02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:35.490
<i>Let alone, one in which someone loved me.</i>

02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:41.580
<i>I started to believe my father's words...</i>

02:07:42.190 --> 02:07:45.030
<i>"You can still live an honest life."</i>

02:07:46.740 --> 02:07:54.280
<i>That faint hope of such a life
began to grow out of my control.</i>

02:08:01.150 --> 02:08:08.390
<i>In that moment, I wanted nothing more than
to protect those two at the cost of my life.</i>

02:08:09.300 --> 02:08:11.200
<i>I never imagined...</i>

02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:19.880
<i>I went to visit my father's grave...</i>

02:08:20.930 --> 02:08:23.600
<i>To tell him I was getting married.</i>

02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:36.550
<i>I returned to the dojo
before the sun had even set.</i>

02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:42.830
<i>But before they even told me...</i>

02:08:44.190 --> 02:08:46.080
<i>I felt a pit open in my stomach.</i>

02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:49.440
<i>And my skin started to crawl.</i>

02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:54.470
Someone poisoned the well!

02:08:55.490 --> 02:08:58.820
Because they knew they couldn't
defeat you or Keizo-san head-on!

02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:00.870
They're monsters!

02:09:01.570 --> 02:09:02.660
It's awful!

02:09:02.900 --> 02:09:05.880
They even killed Koyuki-chan!

02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:14.000
<i>Once again, the most
important people in my life died.</i>

02:09:14.650 --> 02:09:16.660
<i>And I wasn't even there.</i>

02:09:25.810 --> 02:09:28.620
<i>Even though, I promised...</i>

02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:32.990
Am I really good enough?

02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:41.680
Do you remember talking about
coming to see the fireworks as kids?

02:09:43.830 --> 02:09:44.600
Uh...

02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:46.330
Umm...

02:09:48.230 --> 02:09:50.830
That small conversation with you...

02:09:51.370 --> 02:09:55.210
It made me very happy.

02:09:57.190 --> 02:09:59.870
Even if we couldn't
go see them that year...

02:10:00.710 --> 02:10:05.280
You said we could go the
next year or the year after that.

02:10:06.660 --> 02:10:11.540
It's just, I never imagined
living another year.

02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:14.480
Let alone another after that.

02:10:16.290 --> 02:10:17.810
My mother thought the same.

02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:25.300
That's why she killed herself,
so she wouldn't have to see me die.

02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:30.810
Deep down, I knew my
father had given up too.

02:10:32.100 --> 02:10:34.410
I was just so frail.

02:10:35.940 --> 02:10:44.030
But, Hakuji-san, you spoke as
if my future was a matter of fact.

02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:47.920
You made me believe
that there was a next year.

02:10:49.410 --> 02:10:51.460
That made me very happy.

02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:05.600
Yes, you are good enough.

02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:09.120
Will you...

02:11:10.150 --> 02:11:12.200
Please marry me?

02:11:20.590 --> 02:11:21.180
Yes.

02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:27.490
I will become stronger than anyone
and protect you my entire life.

02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:36.120
<i>In the end, it was all just words...</i>

02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:39.040
<i>I couldn't protect a damn thing.</i>

02:11:52.110 --> 02:11:53.340
What are you doing here?

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:56.410
How rude!

02:11:56.930 --> 02:11:59.310
You're from that damn Soryu...

02:12:23.100 --> 02:12:30.780
The surviving student of the Soryu dojo poisoning
attacked the neighboring swordsman dojo.

02:12:31.260 --> 02:12:33.670
The student killed 67 of its members.

02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:37.830
He obliterated their heads and organs.

02:12:38.510 --> 02:12:42.570
Leaving every corpse
mangled and beyond recognition.

02:12:43.030 --> 02:12:45.360
It was like a scene straight out of Hell.

02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:50.340
Jaws, brains, eyeballs, and limbs were scattered
everywhere, sticking to the walls and ceilings.

02:12:50.370 --> 02:12:53.450
The shock caused the maid to lose her mnid.

02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:56.900
This could not have
been an ordinary person!

02:13:20.710 --> 02:13:23.780
I heard fuss about a demon in this area.

02:13:24.550 --> 02:13:26.850
But I didn't remember placing one here.

02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:32.410
I came all the way out here,
just to find an ordinary human.

02:13:33.410 --> 02:13:35.510
How boring.

02:13:36.690 --> 02:13:37.510
Move.

02:13:38.710 --> 02:13:39.350
Or I'll ki—

02:13:44.770 --> 02:13:49.250
I'm considering making 12 powerful demons.

02:13:50.380 --> 02:13:54.700
Can you withstand the
amount of blood I'm about to give you?

02:13:57.010 --> 02:13:58.090
I don't...

02:14:00.910 --> 02:14:04.080
I just don't care anymore...

02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:07.320
About anything...

02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:24.960
<i>I became a demon and lost my memories.</i>

02:14:26.090 --> 02:14:28.860
<i>All I cared about was getting stronger...</i>

02:14:44.380 --> 02:14:47.660
More, give me more!

02:14:52.070 --> 02:14:58.070
<i>Even though there was no
longer anything to protect...</i>

02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:07.540
<i>Honestly, I didn't want to live
in a world without my family.</i>

02:15:10.550 --> 02:15:15.200
<i>But for centuries, I've committed
countless acts of pointless carnage.</i>

02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:19.120
<i>My whole life has always just been...</i>

02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:21.050
<i>A laughable...</i>

02:15:22.820 --> 02:15:24.920
<i>Pathetic story...</i>

02:15:30.650 --> 02:15:32.180
<i>When I die...</i>

02:15:32.730 --> 02:15:35.620
<i>I can't go to the same
place as those three.</i>

02:15:37.530 --> 02:15:42.090
<i>Good job for making me
remember my painful past.</i>

02:15:44.300 --> 02:15:49.120
<i>Humans are soft, fragile, and weak.</i>

02:15:50.410 --> 02:15:52.000
<i>They die easily.</i>

02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:53.660
<i>They break.</i>

02:15:54.500 --> 02:15:56.450
<i>They go away.</i>

02:16:00.030 --> 02:16:01.480
<i>He's not dying!</i>

02:16:01.820 --> 02:16:03.370
<i>That's not possible!</i>

02:16:04.860 --> 02:16:07.110
<i>I have to do it, now.</i>

02:16:08.570 --> 02:16:10.290
<i>If I don't finish him right now...</i>

02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:12.320
<i>We're done for!</i>

02:16:18.780 --> 02:16:21.040
I passed out in the middle of the battle!

02:16:23.490 --> 02:16:26.970
His head!
He's regenerating his head!

02:16:28.860 --> 02:16:30.460
Even though I cut it off!

02:16:36.890 --> 02:16:39.340
<i>Destructive Death, Annihilation Type:</i>

02:16:40.130 --> 02:16:42.290
Stop!

02:16:42.530 --> 02:16:44.880
<i>This kid is still able to move?</i>

02:16:45.420 --> 02:16:50.740
<i>No matter how many times I have to behead him,
Giyu-san and I are going to win against Akaza!</i>

02:16:54.680 --> 02:16:56.000
<i>My sword!</i>

02:16:57.890 --> 02:16:59.610
<i>I don't have any strength...</i>

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:02.200
<i>I can't grip anymore!</i>

02:17:11.510 --> 02:17:15.290
It's time for you to be reformed!

02:17:18.450 --> 02:17:20.580
<i>I hate the weak.</i>

02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:27.190
<i>Weak people never fight face-to-face.</i>

02:17:27.620 --> 02:17:29.280
<i>Instead, they poison wells.</i>

02:17:30.530 --> 02:17:31.820
<i>It makes me sick!</i>

02:17:33.380 --> 02:17:36.990
<i>Weak people lack patience.</i>

02:17:37.590 --> 02:17:39.520
<i>They're quick to give in to despair!</i>

02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:44.290
<i>I killed people with
these fists meant to protect!</i>

02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:49.760
<i>I bloodied my master's
precious Soryu style!</i>

02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:53.350
<i>I couldn't fulfill my father's dying wish!</i>

02:17:56.670 --> 02:18:00.640
<i>That's right, the one I have to kill is...</i>

02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:07.950
<i>This is really, really bad!</i>

02:18:07.970 --> 02:18:09.400
<i>My sword went flying!</i>

02:18:11.460 --> 02:18:13.330
<i>I can't stop him with just my fists!</i>

02:18:24.180 --> 02:18:27.950
<i>Akaza's about to unleash the same
technique he used against Rengoku-san.</i>

02:18:31.730 --> 02:18:34.720
<i>I need to get Giyu-san
outside of the attack's range!</i>

02:18:39.530 --> 02:18:41.250
Forget about me!

02:18:47.210 --> 02:18:48.600
<i>I have to kill them...</i>

02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:55.700
<i>I despise the weak!</i>

02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:41.090
<i>He directed the attack toward himself...</i>

02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:46.240
<i>Why did he attack himself?</i>

02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:48.240
<i>Why?</i>

02:19:51.880 --> 02:19:55.650
<i>For a moment,
Akaza gave off the scent of gratitude.</i>

02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:59.040
<i>Why did he smile?</i>

02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:05.960
<i>Quit it already!</i>

02:20:06.210 --> 02:20:08.260
<i>Stop regenerating!</i>

02:20:09.280 --> 02:20:10.760
<i>The battle is over.</i>

02:20:11.330 --> 02:20:13.090
<i>I lost.</i>

02:20:15.070 --> 02:20:17.770
<i>In that moment, I was defeated.</i>

02:20:18.650 --> 02:20:20.420
<i>It's that simple.</i>

02:20:20.800 --> 02:20:22.600
<i>It was a splendid technique.</i>

02:20:24.390 --> 02:20:28.100
<i>He read my moves and came in perfectly.</i>

02:20:28.730 --> 02:20:32.070
<i>He sliced my neck
before I could even react.</i>

02:20:33.090 --> 02:20:34.340
<i>It's over.</i>

02:20:35.720 --> 02:20:39.720
<i>So just let me go to Hell in peace.</i>

02:20:43.080 --> 02:20:44.660
<i>Where's he going?</i>

02:20:53.010 --> 02:20:54.200
<i>He stopped.</i>

02:20:57.410 --> 02:20:58.490
<i>Dad...</i>

02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:02.080
Are you okay now?

02:21:03.040 --> 02:21:04.400
Are you suffering?

02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:08.420
I'm fine, Hakuji.

02:21:09.770 --> 02:21:11.290
Thank you.

02:21:18.060 --> 02:21:19.580
I'm sorry, Dad.

02:21:20.290 --> 02:21:24.960
I'm sorry, I couldn't live an honest life.

02:21:28.500 --> 02:21:29.960
That doesn't matter.

02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:36.300
Whatever you become, a son is a son,
and a student is a student.

02:21:37.090 --> 02:21:38.970
Not even death can change that.

02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:43.850
But we can't take you to where we are.

02:21:46.580 --> 02:21:47.780
Master...

02:21:50.760 --> 02:21:53.890
Didn't you want to be strong?

02:21:54.760 --> 02:21:57.480
Is this really your end?

02:21:58.250 --> 02:21:59.360
Akaza.

02:22:01.640 --> 02:22:02.690
<i>That's right.</i>

02:22:03.200 --> 02:22:06.790
<i>I want to become stronger and stronger.</i>

02:22:08.070 --> 02:22:10.120
<i>So what if I was beheaded?</i>

02:22:10.370 --> 02:22:12.880
<i>"Defeat" is irrelevant.</i>

02:22:13.570 --> 02:22:16.000
<i>I'll kill all of them!</i>

02:22:16.980 --> 02:22:19.590
<i>I can still get stronger!</i>

02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:23.680
<i>Just like I promised!</i>

02:22:23.940 --> 02:22:25.680
<i>So I can protect you!</i>

02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:37.580
Hakuji-san...

02:22:38.790 --> 02:22:39.870
Thank you.

02:22:40.900 --> 02:22:42.440
You've done enough.

02:22:47.240 --> 02:22:48.390
It's enough.

02:22:49.280 --> 02:22:50.750
It's more than enough.

02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:52.600
Akaza!

02:23:02.890 --> 02:23:04.030
I'm sorry!

02:23:04.170 --> 02:23:06.760
I'm sorry, I couldn't protect you!

02:23:07.460 --> 02:23:10.140
I'm sorry for not being there!

02:23:11.270 --> 02:23:13.810
I couldn't keep a single
one of my promises!

02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:15.050
Forgive me!

02:23:15.810 --> 02:23:17.970
Please, forgive me!

02:23:18.840 --> 02:23:20.580
Forgive me...

02:23:24.830 --> 02:23:29.350
I'm so glad you rememberred us.

02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:35.020
I'm so glad you came back to us, Hakuji-san.

02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:46.650
Welcome back, Hakuji.

02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:54.410
Yo, Hakuji, welcome back!

02:24:03.410 --> 02:24:04.540
I'm back.

02:24:05.960 --> 02:24:07.100
My love.

02:24:11.100 --> 02:24:15.080
Welcome back, dear.

02:24:44.590 --> 02:24:45.780
<i>He's gone...</i>

02:24:57.750 --> 02:24:59.910
It's over...

02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:05.170
We have to hurry...

02:25:06.190 --> 02:25:09.220
Next is Tamayo-san...

02:25:10.740 --> 02:25:11.810
We have to...

02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:20.650
Tanjiro!

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:38.610
Tanjiro and Giyu have defeated Upper Three!

02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:44.010
They have both collapsed from exhaustion!

02:25:49.630 --> 02:25:55.120
Tanjiro and Giyu have defeated Upper Three!

02:25:55.150 --> 02:25:56.270
Defeated!

02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:07.830
Akaza's presence is gone.

02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:12.410
I guess he's fallen.

02:26:16.110 --> 02:26:17.130
Akaza!

02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:22.450
What happened to defeating me?

02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:29.230
He opened a path to attain
even greater strength...

02:26:31.150 --> 02:26:34.050
And he rejected it!

02:26:41.430 --> 02:26:43.810
How exceedingly <i>weak</i>!

02:26:51.550 --> 02:26:52.420
What?

02:26:53.050 --> 02:26:57.150
Did Akaza-dono just d-die?

02:26:58.840 --> 02:27:03.100
That was so strange, was it my imagination?

02:27:04.370 --> 02:27:08.260
It felt like Akaza-dono just
ascended to a new realm of strength.

02:27:11.810 --> 02:27:14.040
But he's dead now,
so I guess I'll never know!

02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:18.810
Um...

02:27:19.440 --> 02:27:20.240
Where were we?

02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:23.040
Oh, right!

02:27:24.010 --> 02:27:26.090
I asked for your name.

02:27:39.430 --> 02:27:44.640
Tanjiro and Giyu have defeated Upper Three!

02:27:44.660 --> 02:27:45.950
Defeated!

02:27:46.690 --> 02:27:47.890
Himejima-san!

02:27:49.470 --> 02:27:51.010
Well done, Tomioka!

02:27:51.910 --> 02:27:53.360
Well done, Kamado!

02:27:59.070 --> 02:28:02.430
Tomioka-san and Tanjiro-kun are awesome!

02:28:02.990 --> 02:28:05.160
We'll follow their lead.

02:28:06.210 --> 02:28:06.830
Yeah!

02:28:22.030 --> 02:28:23.510
Don't die, Agatsuma!

02:28:29.510 --> 02:28:32.960
Hurry up or I'll poke you!

02:28:33.490 --> 02:28:36.750
Take me to the strongest demon here!

02:28:37.010 --> 02:28:38.190
Got it?

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:40.990
Comin' through!

02:28:42.610 --> 02:28:44.230
Who's hidin' in here?

02:28:44.250 --> 02:28:46.920
You can't hide from me forever!

02:28:53.760 --> 02:28:55.150
<i>Brother, where are you?</i>

02:29:05.770 --> 02:29:07.410
Bring me an Upper Rank!

02:29:07.770 --> 02:29:08.790
Upper Rank!

02:29:10.730 --> 02:29:12.600
You can't escape from me!

02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:26.040
Layer 88 has been completely searched,
no sign of Muzan.

02:29:27.520 --> 02:29:31.750
Layers 27 and 100, no sign of Muzan.

02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:34.320
Where is he?

02:29:34.630 --> 02:29:37.040
Nowhere between 90 and 100.
Where are you?

02:29:38.050 --> 02:29:42.070
Layers 40 and 50 completely searched,
no sign of Muzan.

02:29:44.710 --> 02:29:48.830
Layers 33 and 100 completely searched,
no sign of Muzan.

02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:54.970
Our crows will definitely find you.

02:29:56.160 --> 02:29:58.630
We'll search every inch of this castle.

02:29:59.420 --> 02:30:03.180
Searching each and every corner
until we find you.

02:30:18.670 --> 02:30:20.800
Multi-structure moving north.

02:30:21.730 --> 02:30:24.810
Upper Rank positions lost!

02:30:25.710 --> 02:30:26.890
It's folding inward!

02:30:31.170 --> 02:30:32.390
It's all been merged!

02:30:39.550 --> 02:30:40.760
This is...

02:30:42.680 --> 02:30:46.630
No, we can't lose.

02:30:47.640 --> 02:30:49.350
Crows show me!

02:30:50.090 --> 02:30:51.510
Some sign of Muzan!

02:30:56.710 --> 02:30:58.890
You'll never reach me!

02:30:59.610 --> 02:31:03.410
You think I care if my subordinates die?

02:31:04.150 --> 02:31:11.880
As long as I'm alive,
this is all pointless!

02:31:15.910 --> 02:31:21.430
You'll die without ever seeing my face!

02:31:21.880 --> 02:31:24.910
I'm telling you all your
effort is meaningless!

02:31:26.410 --> 02:31:31.240
I will make sure each of
your lives ends with regret!

02:31:32.910 --> 02:31:36.450
Suffer and writhe.

02:31:37.070 --> 02:31:44.440
Because by the end of the night,
all you Demon Slayers will be wiped out!

02:31:55.900 --> 02:31:57.290
Don't die...

02:32:01.050 --> 02:32:02.780
Giyu!

02:32:09.970 --> 02:32:13.250
Don't die on me, Tanjiro.
